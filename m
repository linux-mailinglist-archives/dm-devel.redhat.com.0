Yes, that is what I meant when complaining about the last dm-crypt patch.

I think inline encryption for block devices is a good idea; my complaint was
integration with dm-crypt - as it can dilute expectations and create a new
threat model here.

But I also think that implementing this directly in the block layer makes sense.
Perhaps it should be generic enough.
(I can imagine dynamic inline encryption integrated into LVM ... :-)

I think you should support setting logical encryption size from the beginning,
at least prepare API for that. It has a big impact on performance.
The dm-crypt also requires aligned IO here. We propagate new logical size
to upper layers (and also to loop device below, if used).
(Also this revealed hacks in USB enclosures mapping unaligned devices...)
