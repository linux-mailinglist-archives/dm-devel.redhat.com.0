Thanks Benjamin,

Thanks for your reply. After I posted this question, I went through the
source code and figured out that these functions are defined as weak. So
they are not getting added to the library and binaries which are using them
are re-defining these definitions.

I will try the suggestions as per below. But as a work around, we tried to
use the RedHat 7 version of RPM to see if it works and it worked.

Anyhow, I will definitely try the suggestion and get back to you.

Thanks once again,
Sudhakar.

Using libmpathpersist is kind of tricky. Later version of<br>
device-mapper-multipath clean this up. But for the version in RHEL-8,<br>
your binary needs to specify some things to work with libmpathpersist.<br>
<br>
If your program is single threaded, then you should add something like<br>
(pulled from mpathpersist/main.c):<br>
<br>

<br>
struct config *get_multipath_config(void)<br>
{<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 return multipath_conf;<br>

<br>
void put_multipath_config(__attribute__((unused)) void * arg)<br>
{<br>
=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 /* Noop for now */<br>
}<br>
<br>
void rcu_register_thread_memb(void) {}<br>
<br>
void rcu_unregister_thread_memb(void) {}<br>
<br>
struct udev *udev;<br>

<br>
If you don&#39;t call all the mpathpersist commands with verbose =3D -1,<br=

the library can log errors. Setting logsink to 0 will log them with a<br>
timestamp. setting it to -1 will not add the timestamp.<br>
<br>
Your main funciton also needs to set up these variables. It should<br>
include something like (again pulled from mpathpersist/main.c):<br>
<br>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>

<br>
Both of these functions can return NULL on error.<br>
<br>
