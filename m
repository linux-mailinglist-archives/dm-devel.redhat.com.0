Semantics of writes through shared mmaps are a nightmare.  Agreed,
including agreeing that this is neither new nor pmem specific.  But
it also has absolutely nothing to do with the new RWF_ flag.

The "only" think we need is something like the exception table we
use in the kernel for the uaccess helpers (and the new _nofault
kernel access helper).  But I suspect refitting that into userspace
environments is probably non-trivial.

I think you misunderstood me.  I don't think pmem needs to be
decoupled from the read/write path.  But I'm very skeptical of adding
a new flag to the common read/write path for the special workaround
that a plain old write will not actually clear errors unlike every
other store interfac.

How?
