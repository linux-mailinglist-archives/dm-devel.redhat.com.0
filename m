I'm tracking down a bug where it appears that either "multpath -u"
failed and caused this issue or incorrectly returned
DM_MULTIPATH_DEVICE_PATH=1. I'm still not sure what exactly happened,
but when going over the code I noticed this issue was possible and it
doesn't seem like it should be. I don't think it's very likely that this
is the issue that occurred in the bug I'm looking into, but I do think
that this is possible for errors other than a config problem.  First,
any memory issue would cause this. Obviously, there's a good chance
that the whole system has bigger issues in that case. Second, we do rely
on the udev library to not fail in a number of places, notably
path_discovery(). Third, we rely on filesystem code in places like
is_failed_wwid(). None of these issue individually bothers me, but since
we can protect the system from an unexpected failure here, it seems
reasonable to do so. Obviously we can solve all of them except a memory
failure or an init_config() issue by making sure check_path_valid() never
returns failure in the uevent case, but it seems more reasonable to me
to actually fail, and have udev handle that. But like I said, I don't
think I've actually seen this issue in practice.

I don't think the udev changes are that intrusive, they only happen in
case where you are running with "find_multipaths smart" and getting a
uevent for a MAYBE path, and aside from changing

ENV{FIND_MULTIPATHS_WAIT_CANCELLED}!="?*", \
        ENV{FIND_MULTIPATHS_WAIT_UNTIL}=="?*", \
        ENV{FIND_MULTIPATHS_WAIT_UNTIL}!="0", \
        ENV{FIND_MULTIPATHS_WAIT_CANCELLED}="1", \
        RUN+="/usr/bin/systemctl stop cancel-multipath-wait-$kernel.timer"

Into:

ENV{FIND_MULTIPATHS_WAIT_CANCELLED}=="?*", GOTO="end_mpath"
ENV{FIND_MULTIPATHS_WAIT_UNTIL}!="?*", GOTO="end_mpath"
ENV{FIND_MULTIPATHS_WAIT_UNTIL}=="0", GOTO="end_mpath"

ENV{FIND_MULTIPATHS_WAIT_CANCELLED}="1"
RUN+="/usr/bin/systemctl stop cancel-multipath-wait-$kernel.timer"

which is functionally the same, the only change is to check if
"multipath -u" failed, and if so, set DM_MULTIPATH_DEVICE_PATH=0,
instead of what we are currently doing implicitly with the

IMPORT{db}="DM_MULTIPATH_DEVICE_PATH"

which is to set DM_MULTIPATH_DEVICE_PATH=1 if "multipath -u" failed.

Unless it turns out that my bug was acutally caused by this, I'm not
super invested in these changes, but I do think they are a reasonable
way to catch an unlikely issue, without having to design the multipath
code around the possibility.
