Hi Mike,

Thanks for the quick reply.

I couldn't find this constraint documented anywhere and since the
various DM targets seem to allow message operations while the device is
suspended I drew the wrong conclusion.

Thanks for clarifying this.

Ack.

The sequence of operations I provided is just a way to easily reproduce
the deadlock. The exact issue I am facing is the following:

1. Create device with dm-era target

     # dmsetup create eradev --table "0 1048576 era /dev/datavg/erameta /dev/datavg/eradata 8192"

2. Load new table to device, e.g., to resize the device or snapshot it.

     # dmsetup load eradev --table "0 2097152 era /dev/datavg/erameta /dev/datavg/eradata 8192"

3. Suspend the device

     # dmsetup suspend eradev

4. Someone else, e.g., a user or a monitoring daemon, runs an LVM
    command at this point, e.g. 'vgs'.

5. 'vgs' tries to retrieve the status of the dm-era device using the
    DM_TABLE_STATUS ioctl, and blocks, because the command is queued for
    execution by the worker thread, which is suspended while the device
    is suspended.

    Note, that, LVM uses the DM_NOFLUSH_FLAG, but this doesn't make a
    difference for dm-era, since the "problem" is not that it writes to
    the metadata, but that it queues the metadata read operation to the
    worker thread.

6. Resume the device: This deadlocks.

     # dmsetup resume eradev

So, I am not the one retrieving the status of the suspended device. LVM
is. LVM, when running commands like 'lvs' and 'vgs', retrieves the
status of the devices on the system using the DM_TABLE_STATUS ioctl.

The deadlock is a race that happens when someone runs an LVM command at
the "wrong" time.

Using an appropriate LVM 'global_filter' is a way to prevent this, but:

1. This is just a workaround, not a proper solution.
2. This is not always an option. Imagine someone running an LVM command
    in a container, for example. Or, we may not be allowed to change the
    LVM configuration of the host at all.

Ack. The current behavior of dm-era wrt 'status' command is:

1. Queue the 'metadata_get_stats()' function for execution by the worker
    thread.
2. The worker runs the function and retrieves the statistics
3. The worker commits the metadata _after_ retrieving the statistics

Shall I just change 'era_status()' to read the metadata directly and
skip the metadata commit, instead of queuing the operation to the worker
thread, when the device is suspended?

I think we would still need a lock to synchronize access to the
metadata, since, if I am not mistaken, the pre-resume hook that starts
the worker runs before clearing the DMF_SUSPENDED flag, and can run
concurrently with the 'status' IOCTL. So, the worker might run
concurrently with a 'status' operation that sees the device as
suspended.
