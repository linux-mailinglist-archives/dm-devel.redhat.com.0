The way out of this is to chuck the array in the bin. As I mentioned in
one of my other emails when a scenario happens as you described above
and the array does not inform the initiator it goes against the SAM-5
standard.

That standard shows:
5.14 Unit attention conditions
5.14.1 Unit attention conditions that are not coalesced
Each logical unit shall establish a unit attention condition whenever
one of the following events occurs:
 a) a power on (see 6.3.1), hard reset (see 6.3.2), logical unit
reset (see 6.3.3), I_T nexus loss (see 6.3.4), or power loss expected
(see 6.3.5) occurs;
 b) commands received on this I_T nexus have been cleared by a
command or a task management function associated with another I_T nexus
and the TAS bit was set to zero in the Control mode page associated
with this I_T nexus (see 5.6);
 c) the portion of the logical unit inventory that consists of
administrative logical units and hierarchical logical units has been
changed (see 4.6.18.1); or
 d) any other event requiring the attention of the SCSI
initiator device.

Especially the I_T nexus loss under a is an important trigger.

---
6.3.4 I_T nexus loss
An I_T nexus loss is a SCSI device condition resulting from:

a) a hard reset condition (see 6.3.2);
b) an I_T nexus loss event (e.g., logout) indicated by a Nexus Loss
event notification (see 6.4);
c) indication that an I_T NEXUS RESET task management request (see 7.6)
has been processed; or
d) an indication that a REMOVE I_T NEXUS command (see SPC-4) has been
processed.
An I_T nexus loss event is an indication from the SCSI transport
protocol to the SAL that an I_T nexus no
longer exists. SCSI transport protocols may define I_T nexus loss
events.

Each SCSI transport protocol standard that defines I_T nexus loss
events should specify when those events
result in the delivery of a Nexus Loss event notification to the SAL.

The I_T nexus loss condition applies to both SCSI initiator devices and
SCSI target devices.

If a SCSI target port detects an I_T nexus loss, then a Nexus Loss
event notification shall be delivered to
each logical unit to which the I_T nexus has access.

In response to an I_T nexus loss condition a logical unit shall take
the following actions:
a) abort all commands received on the I_T nexus as described in 5.6;
b) abort all background third-party copy operations (see SPC-4) that
are using the I_T nexus;
c) terminate all task management functions received on the I_T nexus;
d) clear all ACA conditions (see 5.9.5) associated with the I_T nexus;
e) establish a unit attention condition for the SCSI initiator port
associated with the I_T nexus (see 5.14
and 6.2); and
f) perform any additional functions required by the applicable command
standards.
---

This does also mean that any underlying transport protocol issues like
on FC or TCP for iSCSI will very often trigger aborted commands or UA's
as well which will be picked up by the kernel/respected drivers.
