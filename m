I do not have any good ideas.

It is not specific to an array.

We use it for iscsi. We have fast networks and arrays, but to better 
utilize them you need to use multiple iscsi sessions (tcp 
connection/socket). So you typically set it up like how nvme/tcp does 
its connections/queues by default where that driver will create a TCP 
connection per CPU then map the connection to a hw queue/ctx. For iscsi, 
we set the session's IO xmit thread's affinity, then setup networking so 
the socket/connection's IO is routed to the same CPU. We then create N 
sessions and do multipath over them.

Yeah, I am working on that.
