The main reason was to keep it simple. need_to_delay_reconfig() needs
to be passed a "vecs" pointer, and requires the vecs lock to be
held.=A0remove_map() is deep down in the call stack and has lots of
direct and indirect callers. It can be called with mpvec =3D=3D NULL and
(in theory) also with pathvec =3D=3D NULL, in which case it simply frees
the memory obtained by the map, without unlinking itself or its members
from any vectors.=A0In that case it *could* be called without the vecs
lock held (AFAICS, that's not the case today, but the function could be
used this way, e.g. in an error handling code path).

I thought it was easier and safer not to have to assert that every
current and future caller holds the vecs lock, in particular because
this is called indirectly from libmultipath, the function that grabs
the lock is usually high up in the call stack.

I had indeed pondered whether I should remove the call to
need_to_delay_reconfig() from the ev_add_map(), too. I decided against
it, because I realized that waking up child() for nothing is not
cheap,as child() needs to grab the vecs lock just for calling
need_to_delay_reconfig(). We should avoid this for the common case of=20
an uevent which we are waiting for.=A0
The remove_map() code path, OTOH, is a corner case (map being removed
while in the process of being added). We need to cover it, but we know
that this code path will be rarely executed in practice, and thus
unlikely to cause vecs lock contention.

I hope this makes sense.

Martin
