Right, but having a default scsi_dh.conf file that just has a comment
header explaining what it is won't make anything get installed to
modules-load.d by default. You already made that install command
conditional. It just means that running

make SCSI_DH_MODULES_PRELOAD=3D"scsi_dh_rdac scsi_dh_emc" install

will succeed, and give you a scsi_dh.conf in the modules-load.d
directory that loads those modules, instead of failing because there is
no scsi_dh.conf file to install. If you're against having a default
scsi_dh.conf for install to work with, I suppose another option would be
add the modules to scsi_dh.conf first, and then install it. Something
like

ifneq ($(SCSI_DH_MODULES_PRELOAD),)
=09> scsi_dh.conf
        for _x in $(SCSI_DH_MODULES_PRELOAD); do echo "$$_x"; done \
            >>scsi_dh.conf
        $(INSTALL_PROGRAM) -m 644 scsi_dh.conf $(DESTDIR)$(modulesloaddir)/=
scsi_dh.conf
endif

But you have to truncate or remove the local copy of scsi_dh.conf first,
otherwise you would just keep adding the same modules on to the end.
This would mean that distros can't make their own custom scsi_dh.conf.
It would just be generated.

If none of this seems o.k. to you, at the very least you should change
the commit message to metion that

make SCSI_DH_MODULES_PRELOAD=3D"scsi_dh_rdac scsi_dh_emc" install

will only work if you've already created a file named scsi_dh.conf in
the multipath directory.
