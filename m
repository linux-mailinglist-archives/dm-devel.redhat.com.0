Does DM core currently even have this context from the drivers?

I didn't think it through well, but from the top of my head maybe the
execution context
info can be passed over between different storage layers in the bio
structure? For example,
if a driver completes a read in interrupt context - it sets a flag in
the bio structure and passes
it up the stack. Later, if an intermediate layer changes the execution
context (for example,
dm-crypt offloading the bio processing to a workqueue), that layer
updates the flag and so
on. The same applies to write path: writes are generally started in a
preemptible context, but
if we have some obscure DM module, which will schedule a tasklet for a
write, that module must
update the flag in the bio structure.

Basically, the idea is that a bio processing code will get the current
execution context from an upper/lower
layer and if the code itself changes the execution context, that code
is able to update the execution context
info in the bio before passing it on.

This thinking may be flawed of course as I don't know enough details
about the Linux storage layers and how
well the ownership of bios are defined.
