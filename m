Sorry for the delay in responding. It took me a while to test out the design idea
suggested by Mike.

The current implementation is indeed incorrect. However, I've been able to develop
a working prototype that addresses the problem identified in the existing implementation.
I still need some additional time to fine-tune and clean up the prototype.

My goal is to have everything ready and send it out next month.

In my implemention, it is a new hook in the device mapper layer. 
The hook is triggered just before activating an inactive table of a mapped device.
So in our case, we use the hook to attached the dm-verity's roothash metadata
to the block_device struct of mapped device.

It is in the __bind function in drivers/md/dm.c, calling just before 
rcu_assign_pointer(md->map, (void *)t) which activates the inactive table.
