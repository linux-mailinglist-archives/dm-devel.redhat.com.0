Hi Darrick,

Thanks for your patient explanation.

Do you know if XFS log records still use buffer write? In other words, they cannot be written into the block device in DAX mode, right?

In fact, I can reproduce the inconsistent filesystem issue on
generic/482 but cannot reproduce the issue on generic/470.

Where can I find the Christoph's patch set you mentioned.
I just want to know the content of Christoph's patch set.

Good idea, I have sent a patch set to do it.

As far as I know, cxl.mem will take use of nvdimm driver and can be used by many existing applications.
