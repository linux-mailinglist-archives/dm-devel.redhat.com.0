Hello,

Just an update on this.  The issue so far has been traced to the alignment of
the crypto multiplication function fe_mul_impl in lib/crypto/curve25519-fiat32.c.

This patch e5be15767e7e ("hex2bin: make the function hex_to_bin constant-time")
allowed for the alignment to be just right to cause the failure.  Without
this patch and forcing the alignment we can reproduce the issue.  So though the
bisect is correct, this patch is not the root cause of the issue.

Using some l.nop sliding techniques and some strategically placed .align
statements I have been able to reproduce the issue on:

  - gcc 11 and gcc 12
  - preempt and non-preempt kernels

I have not been able to reproduce this on my FPGA, so far only QEMU.  My
hunch now is that since the fe_mul_impl function contains some rather long basic
blocks it appears that timer interrupts that interrupt qemu mid basic block
execution somehow is causing this.  The hypothesis is it may be basic block
resuming behavior in qemu that causes incosistent behavior.

It will take a bit more time to trace this.  Since I maintain OpenRISC QEMU the
issue is on me.

Again, It's safe to say that patch e5be15767e7e ("hex2bin: make the function
hex_to_bin constant-time") is not an issue.
