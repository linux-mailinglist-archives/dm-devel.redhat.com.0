If we need changes to the queue limits we're doing something wrong I
think, as all these limitation only actually apply to bios that use
inline encryption and thus should be dynamic decisions.

Note that discard_zeroes_data is gone already, all zeroing must use
REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES.

Yes, this is fixed now.

Also fixed by the block_device/hd_struct merged as the lookup is gone
entirely now.

An ioctl is by definition perfomed on an open file handle, so it will by
definition be open.  But I don't think that check really is needed to be
so strict.  We can require the ioctl to be on an FMODE_EXCL file handle
which is a good sanity check and otherwise you get what you ask for.

We could of course find a way to mostly reuse the dm-crypt text based setup
syntax even on a block device if that helps.
