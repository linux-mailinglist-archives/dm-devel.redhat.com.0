This series creates an ESSIV template that produces a skcipher or AEAD
transform based on a tuple of the form '<skcipher>,<shash>' (or '<aead>,<shash>'
for the AEAD case). It exposes the encapsulated sync or async skcipher/aead by
passing through all operations, while using the cipher/shash pair to transform
the input IV into an ESSIV output IV.

Changes since v10:
- Drop patches against fscrypt and dm-crypt - these will be routed via the
  respective maintainer trees during the next cycle
- Fix error handling when parsing the cipher name from the skcipher cra_name
- Use existing ivsize temporary instead of retrieving it again
- Expose cra_name via module alias (#4)

Changes since v9:
- Fix cipher_api parsing bug that was introduced by dropping the cipher name
  parsing patch in v9 (#3). Thanks to Milan for finding it.
- Fix a couple of instances where the old essiv(x,y,z) format was used in
  comments instead of the essiv(x,z) format we adopted in v9

Changes since v8:
- Remove 'cipher' argument from essiv() template, and instead, parse the
  cra_name of the skcipher to obtain the cipher. This is slightly cleaner
  than what dm-crypt currently does, since we can get the cra_name from the
  spawn, and we don't have to actually allocate the TFM. Since this implies
  that dm-crypt does not need to provide the cipher, we can drop the parsing
  code from it entirely (assuming the eboiv patch I sent out recently is
  applied first) (patch #7)
- Restrict the essiv() AEAD instantiation to AEADs whose cra_name starts with
  'authenc('
- Rebase onto cryptodev/master
- Drop dm-crypt to reorder/refactor cipher name parsing, since it was wrong
  and it is no longer needed.
- Drop Milan's R-b since the code has changed
- Fix bug in accelerated arm64 implementation.

Changes since v7:
- rebase onto cryptodev/master
- drop change to ivsize in #2
- add Milan's R-b's

Changes since v6:
- make CRYPTO_ESSIV user selectable so we can opt out of selecting it even
  if FS_ENCRYPTION (which cannot be built as a module) is enabled
- move a comment along with the code it referred to (#3), not that this change
  and removing some redundant braces makes the diff look totally different
- add Milan's R-b to #3 and #4

Changes since v5:
- drop redundant #includes and drop some unneeded braces (#2)
- add test case for essiv(authenc(hmac(sha256),cbc(aes)),aes,sha256)
- make ESSIV driver deal with assoc data that is described by more than two
  scatterlist entries - this only happens when the extended tests are being
  performed, so don't optimize for it
- clarify that both fscrypt and dm-crypt only use ESSIV in special cases (#7)

Changes since v4:
- make the ESSIV template IV size equal the IV size of the encapsulated
  cipher - defining it as 8 bytes was needlessly restrictive, and also
  complicated the code for no reason
- add a missing kfree() spotted by Smatch
- add additional algo length name checks when constructing the essiv()
  cipher name
- reinstate the 'essiv' IV generation implementation in dm-crypt, but
  make its generation function identical to plain64le (and drop the other
  methods)
- fix a bug in the arm64 CE/NEON code
- simplify the arm64 code by reusing more of the existing CBC implementation
  (patch #6 is new to this series and was added for this reason)

Changes since v3:
- address various review comments from Eric on patch #1
- use Kconfig's 'imply' instead of 'select' to permit CRYPTO_ESSIV to be
  enabled as a module or disabled entirely even if fscrypt is compiled in (#2)
- fix an issue in the AEAD encrypt path caused by the IV being clobbered by
  the inner skcipher before the hmac was being calculated

Changes since v2:
- fixed a couple of bugs that snuck in after I'd done the bulk of my
  testing
- some cosmetic tweaks to the ESSIV template skcipher setkey function
  to align it with the aead one
- add a test case for essiv(cbc(aes),aes,sha256)
- add an accelerated implementation for arm64 that combines the IV
  derivation and the actual en/decryption in a single asm routine
