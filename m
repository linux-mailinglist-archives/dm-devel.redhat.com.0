The concern I have with dax_clear_poison() is that it precludes atomic
error clearing. Also, as Boris and I discussed, poisoned pages should
be marked NP (not present) rather than UC (uncacheable) [1]. With
those 2 properties combined I think that wants a custom pmem fault
handler that knows how to carefully write to pmem pages with poison
present, rather than an additional explicit dax-operation. That also
meets Christoph's requirement of "works with the intended direct
memory map use case".
