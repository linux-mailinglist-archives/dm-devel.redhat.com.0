Overall, I think it's an ok approach and certainly a good use case for
the bulk allocator.

The main concern that I have is that the dm-crypt use case doesn't really
want to use lists as such and it's just a means for collecting pages to pass
to bio_add_page(). bio_add_page() is working with arrays but you cannot
use that array directly as any change to how that array is populated will
then explode. Unfortunately, what you have is adding pages to a list to
take them off the list and put them in an array and that is inefficient.

How about this

1. Add a callback to __alloc_pages_bulk() that takes a page as a
   parameter like bulk_add_page() or whatever.

2. For page_list == NULL && page_array == NULL, the callback is used

3. Add alloc_pages_bulk_cb() that passes in the name of a callback
   function

4. In the dm-crypt case, use the callback to pass the page to bio_add_page
   for the new page allocated.

It's not free because there will be an additional function call for every
page bulk allocated but I suspect that's cheaper than adding a pile of
pages to a list just to take them off again. It also avoids adding a user
for the bulk allocator list interface that does not even want a list.

It might mean that there is additional cleanup work for __alloc_pages_bulk
to abstract away whether a list, array or cb is used but nothing
impossible.
