Nice :) I haven't personally looked at the gcov output in ages, you
might motivate me to see if I can get the kbuild issue for ktest
integration sorted out.

Just running xfstests won't exercise a lot of the code though - our own
tests are written as ktest tests, and those exercise e.g. multiple
devices (regular raid mode, tiering, erasure coding),
subvolumes/snapshots, all the compression/checksumming/encryption modes,
etc.

No doubt our test coverage will still need improving :)

Fault injection points will be the first thing to look at, as well as
any chunks of code that just have missing tests.

We won't have to manually add individual fault injection points in every
case: once code tagging and dynamic fault injection go in, that will
give us distinct fault injection points for every memory allocation, and
then it's a simple matter to enable a 1% failure rate for all memory
allocations in the bcachefs module - we'll do this in
bcachefs_antagonist in ktest/tests/bcachefs/bcachefs-test-libs, which
runs after mounting.

Similarly, we'll also want to add fault injection for transaction
restart points.

Fault injection is just the first, easiest thing I want people looking
at, it won't be the best tool for the job in all situations. Darrick's
also done cool stuff with injecting filesystem errors into the on disk
image - he's got a tool that can select which individual field to
corrupt - and I want to copy that idea. Our kill_btree_node test (in
single_device.ktest) is some very initial work along those lines, we'll
want to extend that.

And we will definitely want to still be testing with dm-flakey because
no doubt those techniques won't catch everything :)

> It seems like extreme amount of work.

It is a fair amount of work - but it's a more focused kind of work, with
a benchmark to look at to know when we're done. In practice, nobody but
perhaps automotive & aerospace attains full 100% branch coverage. People
generally aim for 80%, and with good, easy to use fault injection I'm
hoping we'll be able to hit 90%.

IIRC when we were working on the predecessor to bcachefs and had fault
injection available, we were hitting 85-88% code coverage. Granted the
codebase was _much_ smaller back then, but it's still not a crazy
unattainable goal.
