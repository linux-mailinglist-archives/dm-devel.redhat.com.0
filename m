Perhaps an array might abort I/Os it has received in the Device Server
whensomething changes.  I have no idea if most or any arrays actually
do that.
But, what about I/O that has already been queued from the host to
thehost bus adapter?  I don't see how we can abort those I/Os
properly.Most high-performance HBAs have a queue of commands and a
queueof responses, there could be lots of commands queued before
wemanage to notice an interesting status.  And AFAIK there is no
conditionalmechanism that could hold them off (and, they could be in-
flight on thewire anyway).
I get what you are saying about what SAM describes, I just don't see
howwe can guarantee we don't send any further commands after the
statuswith the UA is sent back, before we can understand what happened.
