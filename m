I think the issue here is not about the scope of IPE but the use cases
of IPE. 

We use IPE on fixed-function devices, which are completely locked down.
In our system, IPE denies all anonymous memory execution so memfd will
not work on our system.

Therefore, to make memfd useable with IPE we must add more properties.
