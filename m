Discussed in the previous patch (multipathd: fix missing persistent
reseravtion for active path) as follows:

There may be some mistakes. I mistakenly thought update_map would
be called multiple times

In check_path, mpath_pr_event_handle is only called pp->state
changes from others to up. Some prkey changes may happen when
pp->state is down, so mpath_pr_event_handle should be called
even pp->prkey is PRKEY_OK.

As Ben said, update_map will not be called repetitively. I think
this patch should be removed.

Thank Ben and Martin.
