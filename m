The events and branches are specified in the job file (YAML file). When
an event occurs on a github repository, github looks at the associated
commit (SHA), and considers the workflows _included in the tree for
this commit_. AFAIU, for "push" events, this means that if a branch B
is pushed with tip commit C, only workflows that exist in C _and_
reference branch B will be run.
(see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workf=
lows)

@Christophe, you will need to consider how he would like to set this up
in your repo. Different repos may have different policies, and it's
possible that you'll have to tweak or amend when you merge pull
requests from myself or other people that include changes to github
actions. For example, you may want to run CI on a different selection
of branches. I currently have little need for CI runs on pull requests,
but for you, that may be exactly what you need. Thinking about it, I'll
add pull-request triggers.

In general, I will separate github related changes from other code
changes, as discussed before. The reason I didn't in this patch set was
that I wanted to advertise my github-action-related work ;-)

Cheers,
Martin
