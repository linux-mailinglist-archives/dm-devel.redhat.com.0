So, what we need to think about is how userspace is expected to actually us=
e and
test the hardware-wrapped keys feature.

My patchset proposed a design where if a block device declares support for
hardware-wrapped keys, then the BLKCRYPTOCREATEKEY and BLKCRYPTOPREPAREKEY
ioctls are available.

Additionally, a specific hardware-internal key hierarchy and KDF is assumed=
 (due
to the need to support ->derive_sw_secret).  While userspace doesn't need t=
o
know these details to use the feature normally, they *must* be known in ord=
er to
test that it's actually working correctly.

If we were to support variants of the feature, such as:

* Hardware-wrapped keys must be created/prepared in some way other than
  BLKCRYPTOCREATEKEY and BLKCRYPTOPREPAREKEY.  (Could you elaborate on=20
  what this way actually is, in your case?)

* Hardware's key hierarchy or KDF is different, so userspace must do someth=
ing
  else when verifying the on-disk ciphertext.

... then we would need to precisely specify these other variants, and defin=
e a
way for userspace to discover what it should do.

In https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211208013534.136590-1-ebiggers@kernel.org, I=
'm
proposing exposing the crypto capabilities of block devices via sysfs.  Tha=
t
could lead to a partial solution, e.g. the kernel could provide a file

=09/sys/block/$disk/queue/crypto/wrapped_keys_variant

... which would allow userspace to discover the supported variant of
hardware-wrapped keys.  I was really hoping that one variant could be
standardized, but that is one possibility.

Okay, great.  If you're adding inline encryption support to dm-crypt (or to
dm-inline-crypt or to the block layer, depending on what people decide is t=
he
best approach), perhaps you should start with standard keys only, to avoid =
a
dependency on the hardware-wrapped keys feature which is still being worked=
 on?

That's correct.  The larger issue is that if you don't support
->derive_sw_secret, then it's likely that your key hierarchy is different
(probably you don't have a "hierarchy", but rather just one key), which wou=
ld
imply that the feature needs to be tested differently.

As per the above, this could be accounted for in the design by allowing mul=
tiple
variants of wrapped keys.  Of course, that would add complexity.
