Hi Mike.

I agree that quality code is more important than documentation.
And I think this code has already solved the problem of a bio extra cloning.

+static void dm_remap_fn(void *context, struct dm_rb_range *node, struct bio *bio)
+{
+	struct mapped_device *md = context;
+
+	/* Set acceptor device. */
+	bio->bi_disk = md->disk;
+
+	/* Remap disks offset */
+	bio->bi_iter.bi_sector -= node->start;
+
+	/*
+	 * bio should be resubmitted.
+	 * We can just add bio to bio_list of the current process.
+	 * current->bio_list must be initialized when this function is called.
+	 * If call submit_bio_noacct(), the bio will be checked twice.
+	 */
+	BUG_ON(!current->bio_list);
+	bio_list_add(&current->bio_list[0], bio);
+}
