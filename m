It started off-list, but I thought this should rather be a public
discussion. I hope that's ok for everybody.

Maybe Debian enforces additional policies I'm unaware of, but
technically, the soname, or filename based library versioning, doesn't
matter if symbol versioning is used [1]. Symbol versioning can be used
in different ways. For libmultipath, we don't attempt to provide
multiple backward-compatible ABIs. We just want to avoid undefined
behavior which would result from an executable calling a library
routine with a different version of the ABI, and this is what our
library versioning scheme achieves. The idea is similar to the kernel's
symvers mechanism, which avoids loading binary-incompatible modules.

I can't tell for Debian, but other distributions haven't complained so
far. I don't think that multipath-tools is the only project that uses
symbol versioning this way.

The libmultipath data structures that libmpathpersist uses are set up
in libmpathpersist, they are opaque to the calling application.
libmpathpersist will require versioned symbols from libmultipath, and
if these don't match, runtime linking will fail. So if you ship
libmpathpersist with a matching libmultipath, you should be fine.

As Ben noted, the same holds for libmpathvalid and libmpathcmd. We
continuously test our ABI using abigail.

On rpm-based distributions,package management will be able to figure
out this kind of (in)compatibility, albeit in a more coarse-grained way
(e.g. the multipathd package requires
libmpathpersist.so.0(LIBMPATHPERSIST_2.1.0)(64bit), which must match
the provided features of the library package). I suppose something
similar exists in the Debian realm, too.

Sure. It's your decision. Time will tell if anyone complains. IIRC the
purpose of libdmmp was to provide a stable API for 3rd-party
applications to use.

>=20

Historic - no. But in general we have the goal that distributions
should be able to customize install paths using make variables, without
having to resort to patching.

Thanks,
