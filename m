Hi

I reproduced the issue that you reported, but I think this is not a bug in 
writecache, but an expected behavior.

Note that O_DIRECT doesn't guarantee that the written data is flushed to 
the stable storage. With O_DIRECT, we bypass kernel page cache, but the 
data may be still cached in the hardware cache inside the disk and if the 
power failure happens, the data may be lost. You need to use the "fsync" 
or "fdatasync" syscall - it will issue the flush command to the disk and 
when it returns, it is guaranteed that the data is persistent.

In a similar way, if we write data to dm-writecache, it is not guranteed 
that the data will be written when the I/O finishes. It may still be 
cached inside dm-writecache, until "fsync" or "fdatasync" is called.

If I add "--end_fsync=1" to the fio command that you posted below, there 
is no longer any data loss - after a reboot, the device will contain 0xff. 
So, dm-writecache works as expected, flushing the data when "fsync" is 
called.
