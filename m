No, it is not "instead".
As shown in https://www.spinics.net/lists/dm-devel/msg45293.html,
there are some different crashes in multipathd with no code change.
When blocking of thread cancellation during udev_monitor_receive_device(),
no crash in udev_monitor_receive_device happens but others still
exist.

Do you mean some patches have been made to solve these problem?
