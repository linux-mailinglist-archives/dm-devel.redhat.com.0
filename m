Yeah, that is on-demand loading stuffs (another story) but my
opinion was that I could see a win of composefs model is that
you could use EROFS + overlayfs + XFS/btrfs to do partial copyup
by using clone_file_range() to copy up within the same fs (since
all layers including the writable layer are actually landed
in the same fs so overlayfs will just clone_file_range()).

In principle, we could do some hack to do clone_file_range()
across different fses which are actually backed by the same
fs for other approaches, but that approach cannot be not
easily landed upstream TBH.
