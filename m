I am no insisting on anything, I want the dm maintainers to agree that
this change is acceptable to take as it is not what is in Linus's tree.
Every time we take a "not upstream" commit, the odds are 90% that it
ends up being wrong, so I need extra review and assurances that it is
acceptable before I can apply it.
