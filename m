Of course, we can, at least for this DM's use case, the bio is issued
from FS or split from DM, and it won't be issued to underlying queue any
more, and simply owned by DM core code.

How can bio (partial)advance change bio's end sector?

bio end sector can be changed only when bio->bi_iter.bi_size is changed
manually(include bio_trim), or ->bi_bdev is changed. But inside one
driver, if the bio is owned by this driver(such as the driver is the
finally layer request based driver), the assumption often can make.
