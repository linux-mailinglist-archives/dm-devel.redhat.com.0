And is that the reason you propose this?
- You want a special exclusive 'one time open' device that 
  self-destructs when closed?

Well I feel it does break existing semantics which is why we wrote
the code the way we did.  The state can be long-lived, the code
that has it open might legitimately want to open it again in
parallel etc. - in general this seems a bad idea.

But if the reason for this is basically "make it harder for 
anything else to access my encrypted swap" and to deliberately
prevent access, then let's approach the requirement from that angle.
Are there alternative implementations with interventions at different
points?  Are there similar requirements for devices that don't need
deferred remove?  If this is indeed the best place to insert this type
of restriction, then we should label it and document it accordingly so
people don't mistakenly use it for the 'normal' case.  (We always keep
libdevmapper and dmsetup in sync with kernel interface extensions, so
we'd seek a tiny patch to do that too.)
