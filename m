Hm, but are they, really? Xose has changed some defaults from multibus
to group_by_prio lately, but I am not sure if that covers all. If we
set group_by_prio automatically without ALUA, we'd probably end up
effectively with MULTIBUS always, as the prio would likely be constant.
But some arrays would prefer FAILOVER, I suppose, perhaps even some of
those with optional ALUA? I am not sure. But this is what really
matters: whether the array should work in active-active or active-
passive mode when there is no ALUA to detect it.

Perhaps you can come up with a better name than
"detect_pgpolicy_prefer_tpg" :-)

To make sure we're on the same boat:

 - detect_pgpolicy defaults to ON
 - detect_pgpolicy_prefer_tpg defaults to OFF for now.

Right?

I expect that active-passive arrays would use STANDBY state for the
passive side, or at least NON-OPTIMIZED. This would effectively be a
failover mode. Anyway, it'll be possible to deactivate the
autodetection. That's kind of awkward for users, as we now from
detect_checker etc., but it works, and fits the way we did this for
other options.
