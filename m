OK, ->bi_end_io is safe because it is only called until the bio is
ended, so we can retrieve the list head and recover ->bi_end_io before
polling.

The same bio can be re-submitted to block layer because of splitting, and
will be linked to current->bio_list[].

BTW, bio splitting can be very often for some dm target, that is why we
don't ignore bio splitting for dm polling.
