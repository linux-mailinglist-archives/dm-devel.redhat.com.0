I agree. Also, I realize that we've bumped the library version too
often in the past. If we add a function, we don't need to bump. Because
a program that needs the added function will require e.g.
foo@LIBMULTIPATH_10.0.0, and this will fail for a library that doesn't
export foo (which is what we want). Likewise for function deletion - a
program that calls the deleted function will fail to link with the
updated library. OTOH, programs that use this version of the ABI
*without* using the functions which are added or removed are unaffected
by the addition / removal.

The only case in which the ABI version must be bumped is when we have
changed functions or data structures.

Furthermore, I believe now that the habit (which I introduced) to list
added functions at the end of the .version files, with comments
indicating when they were added, is useless. We should rather keep the
.version file ordered alphabetically.

Martin
