Anyone using wrong or suboptimal settings on an unsupported
distribution would also NOT be a valid configuration for NetApp
support, right? But they'd be more likely to call support.

Do you have any evidence that such an hardware table entry would
"cause" users to follow this path? I have to say it sounds far-fetched
to me. People who buy NetApp storage should have evaluated the system
requirements and support restrictions beforehand. If they decide to use
an unsupported distribution nonetheless, they will have strong reasons,
and won't be deterred by wrong defaults in multipath-tools. Rather,
they'll look up the settings in your manuals and configure them
manually. If they call NetApp support, support engineers can still ask
them to reproduce their issue in a supported environment.

AFAIU, NetApp doesn't support using upstream multipath-tools at all.
Should we consequently just drop all settings for NetApp storage and
OEMs from the upstream code base? You're certainly aware that distros
like RHEL or SLES get their default settings through upstream, which is
a good thing. Without good upstream defaults, users of these distros
would need to enter the settings manually in multipath.conf rather than
having reasonable settings applied out of the box. That'd be a serious
deterioration of the user experience.

Regards
Martin

PS: Every Linux user understands that "it works" and "it's supported by
the hardware vendor" are two _very_ different things, simply because
there are so few vendors that support Linux at all. I don't think I
ever had a laptop running an officially supported OS.
