Yeah, I agree, this takes me back to learning how to use DISKEDIT to
work around a hole punched in a file (with a pen!) in the 1980s...

...so would you happen to know if anyone's working on solving this
problem for us by putting the memory controller in charge of dealing
with media errors?

The trouble is, we really /do/ want to be able to (re)write the failed
area, and we probably want to try to read whatever we can.  Those are
reads and writes, not {pre,f}allocation activities.  This is where Dave
and I arrived at a month ago.

Unless you'd be ok with a second IO path for recovery where we're
allowed to be slow?  That would probably have the same user interface
flag, just a different path into the pmem driver.

Ha, how about a int fd2 = recoveryfd(fd); call where you'd get whatever
speshul options (retry raid mirrors!  scrape the film off the disk if
you have to!) you want that can take forever, leaving the fast paths
alone?

(Ok, that wasn't entirely serious...)
