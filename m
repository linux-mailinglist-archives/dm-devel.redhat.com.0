I was thinking perhaps another implementation might involve using
open_count on dm_ioctl as an in param on DM_DEV_CREATE only. Using
open_count as an in parameter on DM_DEV_CREATE could be activated by a
new flag, perhaps DM_ENFORCE_OPEN_COUNT_FLAG. This would allow the
behavior to be baked into the device from the start. We would then
enforce it in dm_blk_open. What would you think about an approach like
this?

Thanks,
Brian
