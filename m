Congestion can also be caused by a change in workload characteristics
where, for example, read and write workload start interfering. The
funnel principle would not apply in that case.

If you can interleave IOs with an artificial delay depending on the
type and frequency these FPINS arrive you would be able to prevent
latency buildup in the san.

The entire FPIN concept was designed to be able to provide clients with
the option to respond and react to changing behaviours in sans. A mis-
design is often not really the case but ongoing changes and continuous
provisioning is =C2=A0mainly contributing to the case.=C2=A0

I think the FC drivers are already having facilities to do that or they
will have that shortly. dm-multipath is not really required to handle
the notifications but would be useful if actions have been done based
on fpins.=C2=A0

The FC protocol only describes the framework and not the values that
need to be adhered to. That depends on the end devices and their
capabilities.=C2=A0
