Thanks for the confirmation!

Thanks for the info!

>(or any code equivalent with libcryptsetup), am I correct?

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think there will be a safer way to
preserve key without patching cryptsetup. Actually the --dump-volume-key
approach has been proposed before and I agree with your conclusion [1]
on that approach i.e. "passing volume key this way is quite insecure".
Without patching cryptsetup, even if I save the volume key in the memory
reserved for the kdump kernel, I need to retrieve this key in the
userspace to unlock the LUKS device which may lead to quite a security
vulnerability.

I respect the efforts from you and the cryptsetup community to make LUKS
as secure as possible. And kdump is used in product environment. Kdump
is to a server as a black box is to an aircraft. So by no means I want
to reverse the used security measures and patching cryptsetup can allow
to keep the security measures. One concern raised by you against "FRC
v1" was a copy of the LUKS volume key for the kdump kernel creates an
attack vector. I took this feedback seriously and have sought advice
from my colleagues to implement the countermeasures ([PATCH 1/5] and
[Patch 4/5]).
