As of Linux 5.18, the cloning interfaces have changed and take
a block devie that the clone is intended to be used for, and bio_set_dev
is mostly (there is a few more sports to be cleaned up in
dm/md/bcache/btrfs) only used for remapping to a new device.

That being said I've eyed the code in bio_associate_blkg a bit and
I've been wondering about some of how it is implemented as well.

Is recursive throttling really a thing?  i.e. we can have cgroup
policies on the upper (e.g. dm) device and then again on the lower
(e.g. nvme device)?  I think the code currently supports that, and
if we want to keep that I don't really see much of a way to avoid
the lookup, but maybe we cn make it faster.
