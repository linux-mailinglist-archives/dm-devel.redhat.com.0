Agreed. umount(2) doesn't give guarantees about a filesystem being
really gone once it has returned. And it really shouldn't. There's too
many cases where that doesn't work and it's not a commitment we should
make.

And there are ways to wait until superblock shutdown that I've mentioned
before in other places where it somehow really matters. inotify's
IN_UMOUNT will notify about superblock shutdown. IOW, when it really
hits generic_shutdown_super() which can only be hit after unfreezing as
that requires active references.

So this really can be used to wait for a filesystem to go away across
all namespaces, and across filesytem freezing and it's available to
unprivileged users. Simple example:

# shell 1
sudo mount -t xfs /dev/sda /mnt
sudo mount --bind /mnt /opt
inotifywait -e unmount /mnt

#shell 2
sudo umount /opt # nothing happens in shell 1
sudo umount /mnt # shell 1 gets woken

Agreed.

And now we at least have an api to detect that case and refuse to reuse
the superblock.

Namespaces make this even messier. You have no easy way of knowing
whether the filesystem isn't pinned somewhere else through an explicit
bind-mount or when it was copied during mount namespace creation.
