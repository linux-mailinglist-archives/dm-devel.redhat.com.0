system administrators are usually responsible for system 
policies/configurations.They own modifications in the config files like
ima-policy. That's why we wanted to address them to begin with. But you
are correct. This is not only of interest to sysadmins. I will make the 
description more generic.

Makes sense. Will make the patch description more generic.

Sounds good. Would you prefer "label" or something else like "data_label"?

In the policy file the "label" looks logical and more generic than 
"data_label".
    measure func=CRITICAL_DATA label=selinux

For the time being, I will stick with "label", please let me know if you
prefer something else.

Thanks,
