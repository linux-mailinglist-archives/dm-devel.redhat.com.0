kernel patches are never "spam", sorry, but for developers to try to
determine which lists/maintainers want to see the whole series and which
do not is impossible.

Patches in a series are easily deleted from sane mail clients with a
single click/keystroke all at once, they aren't a problem that needs to
be reduced in volume.
