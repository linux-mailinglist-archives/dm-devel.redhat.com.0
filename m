Thanks for sending this patch!  This looks like a correct fix, but I have some
comments:

* Using "check_at_most_once" is strongly discouraged, as it reduces security.
  If you are using check_at_most_once to improve performance at the cost of
  reduced security, please consider that very recently, dm-verity performance
  has significantly improved due to the removal of the WQ_UNBOUND workqueue flag
  which was causing significant I/O latency.  See commit c25da5b7baf1
  ("dm verity: stop using WQ_UNBOUND for verify_wq").

* I think your commit message does not explain a key aspect of the problem which
  is why is verity even attempted when the underlying I/O has failed?  This
  appears to be because of the Forward Error Correction (FEC) feature.  So, this
  issue is specific to the case where both FEC and check_at_most_once is used.
  Can you make your commit message explain this?

* This patch does not appear to have been received by the dm-devel mailing list,
  which is the list where dm-verity patches should be reviewed on.  It doesn't
  show up in the archive at https://lore.kernel.org/dm-devel.  Also, I'm
  subscribed to dm-devel and I didn't receive this patch in my inbox.  (I had to
  download it from https://lore.kernel.org/lkml instead.)  Did you receive a
  bounce message when you sent this patch?

* Please add 'Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org' to the commit message, just below the
  Fixes line, as per Documentation/process/stable-kernel-rules.rst.  This will
  ensure that the fix will be backported to the stable kernels.

* "Signed-off-by: Sungjong Seo <sj1557.seo@samsung.com>" does not have a
  corresponding Author or Co-developed-line, which is not allowed.  Did you mean
  to list Sungjong as the Author or as a co-author?

* No blank line between Fixes and the Signed-off-by line(s), please.

Thanks!

- Eric
