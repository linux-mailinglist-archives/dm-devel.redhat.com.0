The 2nd measurement is for SELinux state data such as "enforcing", 
"checkreqprot", policycap[__POLICYDB_CAPABILITY_MAX], etc.

For illustrating the use of the new IMA hook, that my colleague Tushar 
has added for measuring kernel critical data, we have included only one 
SELinux measurement in this patch set - the measurement of SELinux 
policy. This also helped in keeping this patch smaller.

When this patch set is merged, I'll post a separate patch to add 
measurement of SELinux state data I have mentioned above.

Sure - I will make that change.

If the system time was adjusted such that the event name is duplicated, 
we could miss measurements - this is not okay.

For example:
  #1 Say, at time T1 SELinux state being measured is "foo" - IMA will 
measure it.
  #2 at time T2, the state changes to "bar" - IMA will measure it
  #3 at time T3, the state changes from "bar" to "foo" again. Unless the 
"event name" passed in the measurement call is different from what was 
passed in step #1, IMA will not measure it and hence we'll miss the 
state change.

If system time can be manipulated to return the same "timer tick" on 
every call to ktime_get_real_ts64(), we will lose measurement in Step #3 
above.

But given that we are using ktime_get_real_ts64() to get the timer tick, 
is it possible to manipulate the system time without compromising the 
overall functioning of the rest of the system? If yes, then it is an 
issue - I mean, there is a possibility of losing some measurements.

Sure - I will change the function name to "__security_read_policy()".
