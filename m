This is a driver for containers and virtual machines. One of basic features
for them is migration and backups. There are several drives for that, which
are already implemented in device-mapper. For example, dm-era and dm-snap.
Instead of implementing such the functionality in QCOW2 driver once again,
the sane behavior is to use already implemented drivers. The module-approach
is better for support and errors eliminating just because of less code.

1)A device-mapper based driver does not require migration and backup devices
  are built in a stack for the whole device lifetime:

  a)Normal work, almost 100% of time: there is only /dev/mapper/qcow2_dev.
  b)Migration: /dev/mapper/qcow2_dev is reloaded with a migration device,
    which points to new qcow2_dev.real:

    /dev/mapper/qcow2_dev          [migration driver]
      /dev/mapper/qcow2_dev.real   [dm-qcow2 driver]
    
   After migration is completed, we reload /dev/mapper/qcow2_dev back
   to use dm-qcow2 driver. So, there is no excess dm layers during normal work.

2)In case of the driver is not a device-mapper based, it's necessary to have
  the stack built for the whole device lifetime, since it's impossible to reload
  bare block driver with dm-based driver on demand:

    /dev/mapper/qcow2_dev          [migration driver]
       /dev/qcow2_dev.real         [bare qcow2 driver]

  So, we would have excess dm layer during whole device lifetime.

Our performance tests show, that a single dm layer may cause up to 10% performance
decrease on NVME, so the reason is to eliminate such the fall. Also, the general
reasoning say that excess layer is a wrong way.

Other reason is previous experience of implementing file-backed block drivers.
We had ploop driver before. Ploop format is much simpler that QCOW2 format, but
there are about 17K strings, while dm-qcow2 driver took about 6K strings.
Device mapper allows to avoid writing a lot of code, the only thing you need
is to implement proper .ctr and .dtr functions, while the rest of configuration
actions are done by simple device-mapper reload.

I don't think so. Device-mapper already allows to replace a device driver with
another driver. Nobody blames dm-linear, that it may be reloaded to point wrong
partition, while it can. Nobody blames loop, that someone in userspace may corrupt
its blocks, and filesystem on that device will become broken.

The thing is kernel and userspace never access the file at the same time.
It case of maintenance actions may be called in userspace, they must be, since
this reduces the kernel code.

Theoretically, I can, in case of this flushes all pending requests. But this
will increase driver code significantly, since there won't be possible to use
reload mechanism, and there are other problems like problems with performance
like I wrote above. So, this approach look significantly worse.
