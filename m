That's very welcome!

There is one remaining problem though, which might be just a cosmetic one: Although ext4 is shut down to prevent it from writing, I sometimes get the error message from the subject in the logs:

This is in fact what we are doing now, after I've rejected the above solution
because of the fear of a leak on the probably not so well tested error path.

You answer encourages me to maybe just try it. The problem is, that if a few pages
or inodes keep hanging around only occasionally, the systems would probably need month
and month until this manifest as a problem. So I'd never know when to declare the
test as finished and trust the solution.

The "rm -r" does help a bit but not as much as I've hoped. It might take half
the time for some workloads but it is still in the same order of magnitude
for typical loads.

I've abandoned the "dm"-path as well, more or less for the same reason:
This would trigger seldom used error paths in the filesystem.

Aside from the already mentioned one, I could think of others usecases:

- You've already unplugged a removable drive. Whatever happened to the data on
the device already happened and you just want to make sure, the system releases
all resources.

- Anything which uses file system images where the final state of the image
doesn't need to be kept (build systems, test systems).

Another idea I've had is to add a ioctl for the block layer which just undirtyes all
pages which go to that backing device. It would help for file data only, not for
the metadata, but I guess that would be enough. I wouldn't need to mess with the
layer under the filesystem. Good idea or bad idea?

But I have the feeling this would be complicated taking all the required locking
and possible in-flight states into account. This could well be over my level. And
it would never be accepted upstream, so I'd need to forward-port that forever.


Thanks!
