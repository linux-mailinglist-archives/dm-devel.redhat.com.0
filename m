If the administrator runs a script that performs unmount and then back-up 
of the underlying block device, it may read corrupted data. I think that 
this is a problem.

Currently, if we freeze a filesystem with "fsfreeze" and unmount it, the 
mount point is removed, but the filesystem stays active and it is leaked. 
You can't unfreeze it with "fsfreeze --unfreeze" because the mount point 
is gone. (the only way how to recover it is "echo j>/proc/sysrq-trigger").

bind-mount doesn't modify "s->s_writers.frozen", so the patch does nothing 
in this case. I tried unmounting bind-mounts and there was no deadlock.

unmounting a filesystem frozen with "fsfreeze" doesn't work in the current 
kernel. We can say that the administrator shouldn't do it. But reading the 
block device after umount finishes is something that the administrator may 
do.

BTW. what do you think that unmount of a frozen filesystem should properly 
do? Fail with -EBUSY? Or, unfreeze the filesystem and unmount it? Or 
something else?

Yes, it may be possible to rework it using a wait queue.
