It would be nice to get people testing the new improvements:

Do you think it can make it for the 6.3 merge window that is open?

Did thinp v2 get dropped, or just turn into the patchset above?

Would be nice to minimize CoW latency somehow if going to userspace=20

slow, but NVMe's are pretty quick to copy a 64k chunk.

To be clear, linear and stripe would stay in the kernel?=20
