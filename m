And you almost got to the initial point in your penult paragraph. A
single if for a single flag is not an issue, what is the problem is
when there are dozens of them and the overhead for it is not isolated,
so the kernel has to jump through dozens of those.

And just to be clear I'll outline again, that's a general problem,
I have no relation to the layers touched and it's up to relevant
people, obviously. Even though I'd expect but haven't found the flag
being rejected in other places, but well I may have missed something.

10M you mentioned is just a way to measure, there is nothing wrong
with it. And considering that there are enough of users considering
or already switching to spdk because of performance, the approach
is not wrong. And it goes not only for IO polling, normal irq IO
suffers from the same problems.

A related story is that this number is for a pretty reduced config,
it'll go down with a more default-ish kernel.

And iomap is great, what you described is a good typical example
of unmaintainable code. I may get wrong what you exactly refer
to, but I don't see maintainability not being considered.

Even more interesting to notice that more often than not extra
features (and flags) almost always hurt maintainability of the
kernel, but then other benefits outweigh (hopefully).
