This did work, but I agree, it is not the best approach. I was looking
for a backstop in case I could not get the kernel change that was the
real fix to the issue. I wanted to give a solution to our customers
who would upgrade into the problem. Having multitpath-tools dealing
with a fail path that isn't really a fail path is clumsy at best. The
kernel fix got in here:

https://git.kernel.org/mkp/scsi/c/6056a92ceb2a

So this patch is no longer needed.

Thanks,
Brian
