Thanks for clarifying the details related to duplicate measurement 
detection and re-measuring.

I will keep the timestamp for the time being, even though its a hack, as 
it helps with re-measuring state changes in SELinux. We will add support 
for "policy driven" re-measurement as a subsequent patch series.
