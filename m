Hi Kyle,

The issue is that the implementations of aead and skcipher in the QAT
driver are not properly supporting requests with the
CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag set.
If the HW queue is full, the driver returns -EBUSY [1] but does not
enqueues the request as dm-crypt expects [2]. Dm-crypt ends up waiting
indefinitely for a completion to a request that was never submitted,
therefore the stall.
This is not related to QATE-7495 'An incorrectly formatted request to
QAT can hang the entire QAT endpoint' [3], which occurs when a malformed
request is sent to the device.

I'm working at patch that resolves this problem. In the meanwhile a
workaround is to blacklist the qat_c3xxx.ko driver.

Regarding avoiding this issue on stable kernels. The usage of QAT with
dm-crypt was already disabled in kernel 5.10 for a different issue
(the driver allocates memory in the datapath).
The following patches implement the change:
    7bcb2c99f8ed crypto: algapi - use common mechanism for inheriting flags
    2eb27c11937e crypto: algapi - add NEED_FALLBACK to INHERITED_FLAGS
    fbb6cda44190 crypto: algapi - introduce the flag CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY
    b8aa7dc5c753 crypto: drivers - set the flag CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY
    cd74693870fb dm crypt: don't use drivers that have CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY
An option would be to send the patches above to stable, another is to wait
for a patch that fixes the problems in the QAT driver and send that to
stable.
@Herbert, what is the preferred approach here?
