Yeah, I think I've done it like above. A more detailed timing diagram is
below.

The order of the removal path is slightly different from this:

     shrink_slab                 unregister_shrinker
     ===========                 ===================
		
    shrinker_try_get()
    rcu_read_unlock()		
                                 1. decrement initial reference
				shrinker_put()
				2. wait for reference to go to zero
				wait_for_completion()
    rcu_read_lock()

    shrinker_put()
				3. remove the shrinker from list
				list_del_rcu()
                                 4. wait for grace period
				kfree_rcu()/synchronize_rcu()


    list_for_each_entry()

    shrinker_try_get()
    rcu_read_unlock()
				5. free the shrinker

So the order is: decrement reference, wait for reference to go to zero,
remove, wait for grace period, free.

I think this can work. And we can only do the *step 3* after we hold the
RCU read lock again, right? Please let me know if I missed something.

Thanks,
Qi
