I don't think we are really making forward progress in the argument which
behavior is more or less correct or useful. But maybe when we cannot agree
on the general solution we could still improve the situation that
practically matters? E.g. disputing Gnome apps telling you you can safely
remove the USB stick when you actually cannot because the filesystem on it
is frozen is actually kind of weak argument because users that freeze
filesystem on their USB stick are practically non-existent. So is there a
usecase where users are hitting these problems in practice? Maybe some user
report that triggered original Mikulas' patch? Or was that mostly a
theoretical concern?

More or less yes but e.g. grub2 isn't able to reliably read images of just
frozen filesystem because it ignores journal contents. So if this was root
filesystem this could result in unbootable system.
