Here we're talking about a device that had been successfully scanned
before (during initramfs processing). In my case it was a partition-on-
multipath device (linear mapping on top of multipath mapping) hosting a
btrfs file system with multiple subvolumes. The problem occurs when the
coldplug "add" event is processed after switching to the real root, and
if the device is in suspended state for whatever reason when that
happens. If the SYMLINK+=3D directive for the /dev/disk/by-uuid link for
the device is skipped in the udev rules, udev will notice and remove
the symlink (which means in the case of multipath: assign it to a
component SCSI device instead).

systemd, however, thinks that the /dev/disk/by-uuid device is ready for
processing and tries to mount it while the symlink wrongly points to
the SCSI device. That fails (the SCSI device is mapped by multipath),
and thus booting fails. See a log excerpt below.=20

It's a race condition. It probably happens while multipathd is
reloading a map (*), suspending it during the table reload. The device
will be resumed a few fractions of a second later (so yes, it's
"quick"), but then it's too late - systemd will already have tried to
mount it, and failed. When emergency mode is reached, all looks fine,
because the device has been resumed and the correct symlink has been
restored by udev while processing the associated CHANGE event.

I can actually see that some of the subvolumes are mounted successfully
and some are not. It all depends on the timing, which device mount(2)
actually accesses when it follows the by-uuid symlink.

I'm not sure what "hack" you're talking about. 13-dm-disk.rules always
skips calling "blkid" for suspended devices. And that's correct.
The point is not to "forget" valid symlinks because scanning is
skipped.

(*) If a dm device is encountered in such a transient suspended state,
it is very difficult to figure out why / by which process it was
suspended, in particular during boot (tell me if you know a good trick
to figure it out). But multipathd is a likely candidate.

Sample boot log:

Note the message "Updating old device symlink '/dev/disk/by-

belonging to this device"), which is where the trouble starts.
