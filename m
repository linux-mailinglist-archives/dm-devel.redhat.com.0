So this "3." case is meant to illustrate effects of polling when bio is
split to 3 different underlying blk-mq devices. (think it odd that
dm-stripe across 3 nvme devices is performing so much worse than a
single nvme device)

Would be nice to see comparison of this same workload but _with_ CPU
affinity to show relative benefit of your patch 11 in this series (where
you try to leverage CPU pinning).

In general, I don't think patch 11 a worthwhile effort.  It is a
half-measure that is trying to paper over the fact that this bio-based
IO polling patchset is quite coarse grained about how it copes with the
need to poll multiple devices.

Patch 10 is a proper special case that should be accounted for (when a
bio isn't split and only gets submitted to a single blk-mq
device/hctx).  But even patch 10's approach is fragile (we we've
discussed in private and I'll touch on in reply to patch 10).

But I think patch 11 should be dropped and we defer optimizing bio
splitting at a later time with follow-on work.

Just so you're aware, I'm now thinking the proper way forward is to
update DM core, at the time of DM table load, to assemble an array of
underlying _data_ devices in that table (as iterated with
.iterate_devices) -- this would allow each underlying data device to be
assigned an immutable index for the lifetime of a DM table.  It'd be
hooked off the 'struct dm_table' and would share that object's
lifetime.

With that bit of infrastructure in place, we could then take steps to
make DM's cookie more dense in its description of underlying devices
that need polling.  This is where I'll get a bit handwavvy.. but I
raised this idea with Joe Thornber and he is going to have a think about
it too.

But this is all to say: optimizing the complex case of bio-splitting
that is such an integral part of bio-based IO processing needs more than
what you've attempted to do (noble effort on your part but again, really
just a half-measure).

SO I think it best to keep the initial implementation of bio-based
polling relatively simple by laying foundation for follow-on work.  And
it is also important to _not_ encode in block core some meaning to what
_should_ be a largely opaque cookie (blk_qc_t) that is for the
underlying driver to make sense of.

OK, good, this needs to be the case.

Looks like these patch references are stale (was relative to v3 I
think).. e.g: "patch 11" from v3 is really "patch 10" in v5.. but its
implementation has changed because Mikulas pointed out that the
implementation was unsafe.. IIRC?

Anyway, I'll just focus on reviewing each patch in this v5 now.

Thanks,
Mike
