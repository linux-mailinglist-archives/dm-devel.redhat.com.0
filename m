This is all fine even for dm-crypt IF the tweaking is unique for the sector position
(it can be something just derived from the sector offset in principle).

For FDE, we must never allow writing sectors to different positions with the same
tweak (IV) and key - there are real attacks based on this issue.

So zones can do any recalculation and reshuffling it wants if sector tweak
in dm-crypt is unique.
(Another solution would be to use different keys for different areas, but that
is not possible with dm-crypt or FDE in general, but fs encryption can do that.)

If you want dm-crypt to support zones properly, there is a need for emulation
of the real sector offset - because that is what IV expects now.

And I think such emulation should be in DM core, not in dm-crypt itself, because other
targets can need the same functionality (I guess that dm-integrity journal
has a problem with that already, Mikulas will know more).

For online reencryption we also use multiple targets in the table that dynamically moves
(linear combined with dm-crypt), so dm-crypt must support all commands as
dm-linear to make this work.

I hope I understand the problem correctly; all I want is to so avoid patching
the wrong place (dmcrypt crypto) because that problem will appear elsewhere later.
Also for security it would be nice to not add exceptions to encryption
code - it is always recipe for disaster.

Milan
