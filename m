Just to close the loop on this thread:

As I explained on the other thread in this patch series -

@the hash verification:
the clear-text for the active/inactive table hashes is already logged in
the 'table_load' event. And we will prefix the active/inactive table
hashes with hash_algo.  (e.g. sha256:<hash>) in the remaining events.
Together it should be sufficient for the attestation server to verify
the active/inactive table hashes without maintaining any list of
expected hashes or referring to kernel version etc.

@versioning:
We are already logging versions for individual targets. What was missing
was some versioning at device level. So thanks again for the suggestion.
We will add a version at device level in each of the events. Together
that should help attestation server to determine what attributes to 
expect in the event data - without relying on specific kernel version.

Thanks again for your feedback.

Regards,
Tushar
