Sorry I forgot to update the commit message as the implementation
changed. Actually this mechanism is implemented by patch 10 of this
patch set.

It is implemented as patch 10 of this patch set. When spin_trylock()
fails, the polling instance will return immediately, instead of busy
waiting.

Yes, the mechanism of iterating all hw queues can make the competition
worse.

If every underlying data device has **only** one polling hw queue, then
this ping-pong style polling still exist, even when we implement split
bio tracking mechanism, i.e., acquiring the specific hw queue the bio
enqueued into. Because multiple polling instance has to compete for the
only polling hw queue.

But if multiple polling hw queues per device are reserved for multiple
polling instances, (e.g., every underlying data device has 3 polling hw
queues when there are 3 polling instances), just as what we practice on
mq polling, then the current implementation of iterating all hw queues
will indeed works in a ping-pong style, while this issue shall not exist
when accurate split bio tracking mechanism could be implemented.

As for the performance, I cite the test results here, as summarized in
the cover-letter
(https://lore.kernel.org/io-uring/20210208085243.82367-1-jefflexu@linux.alibaba.com/)

	    | IOPS (IRQ mode) | IOPS (iopoll=1 mode) | diff
----------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----
without opt | 		 318k |		 	256k | ~-20%
with opt    |		 314k |		 	354k | ~13%

The 'opt' refers to the optimization of patch 10, i.e., the skipping
mechanism. There are 3 polling instances (i.e., 3 CPUs) in this test case.


Indeed the current implementation of iterating all hw queues is some
sort of compromise, as I find it really difficult to implement the
accurate split bio mechanism, and to achieve high performance at the
same time. Thus I turn to optimizing the original implementation of
iterating all hw queues, such as optimization of patch 10 and 11.
