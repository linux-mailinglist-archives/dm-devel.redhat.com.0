Sure, but I can do that as a separate patch?

Yep. Something like that is what I was thinking.  But I'm still trying
to come up with a way that paths could get into this state without
someone running something like:

# multipathd del path sda
# mutipath

And I'm not sure how much code we want to add just to handle something
contrived like this.

>=20

Since this is a case where the device nodes do exist, since they were
already made into multipath devices, I didn't run into any problems with
checking INIT_PARTIAL paths.
