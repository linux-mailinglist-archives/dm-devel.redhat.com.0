For a user-initiated fallocate call, I think that's reasonable.

My first thought is to make the XFS allocator issue REQ_OP_PROVISION on
every allocation if the device supports it.  The fs has decided that
it's going to allocate and presumably write to some space, so the
underlying storage really ought to have some space ready.

But then it occurred to me -- what if the IO fails with ENOSPC?  Do we
keep going and hope for the best?  Or maybe we should undo the
allocation?  That could be tricky since we'd have to add a transaction
to undo the allocation, commit that, and then throw an error to the
upper layers.

Should the allocator instead find the space it wants and issue the
provisioning IO with the AGF locked, and try again somewhere else if the
IO returns ENOSPC?  If the space management IO takes forever, we've
pinned the that AG for the duration, which is one of the not very nice
aspects of the XFS FITRIM implementation on crappy SSDs.

For a directio write, it's simple enough to throw that error back to
userspace.  I think the same applies to buffered writeback -- we'll
cancel the writeback and set AS_ENOSPC on the mapping.

But then, what about *metadata* allocation?  If those fail because the
provisioning encounters ENOSPC, we'll shut down the filesystem, which
isn't nice.  For XFS I guess we could reuse the existing metadata IO
error config knobs to make it retry for some amount of time until
(hopefully) the admin buys more storage.

Let's go with the simplest implementation (issue it with the free space
locked), and iterate from there.

Hmm.  Currently, fallocate'ing part of a file that's already mapped to
shared blocks is a nop.  That's technically an omission in the
implementation, since a subsequent write can fail during COW setup due
to insufficient space.  My memory about funshare is a bit murky since
it's been years now.

As I remember it, originally, I had allocate mode also calling unshare,
but Dave or someone pointed out that unsharing generates a flood of
dirty pagecache, and it would be a bit surprising that fallocate
suddenly takes a long time to run.  There also wasn't much precedent for
fallocate to unshare blocks, since btrfs doesn't do that:

I took funshare out of the patchset entirely (minimum viable product,
yadda yadda) and a few months later, I think hch or someone asked for a
knob for userspace to get a file back to pure overwrite mode.  That's
where it's been ever since.

So to answer your question: fallocate mode 0 and REQ_OP_PROVISION
probably ought to be allocating the holes and unsharing existing shared
mappings.  However, we could also wriggle out of that by <cough>
claiming that fallocate has been consistent across filesystems in
leaving that wart for userspace to trip over. :/
