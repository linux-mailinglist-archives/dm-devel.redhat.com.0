Hi,

I think you are creating another attack vector here, storing the encryption
key to yet another place... but I already mentioned that in the referenced mail.

Why is it not done through keyring and forcing kdump to retain key there
(under the same keyring key name as dm-crypt used)?
Kernel dm-crypt supports this already; LUKS2 uses keyring by default too.
That's all you need, or not? Why do you need to add another "kdump:" thing?
IOW why kdump cannot copy the key to keyring under the name dm-crypt
has in the mapping table and let dm-crypt activate the device almost without
code changes?

Anyway, please fix the naming before this patchset can be read or reviewed!

LUKS is user-space key management only (on-disk metadata); the kernel has
no idea how the key is derived or what LUKS is - dm-crypt only knows the key
(either through keyring or directly in the mapping table).

Polluting kernel namespace with "luks" names variables is wrong - dm-crypt
is used in many other mappings (plain, bitlocker, veracrypt, ...)
Just use the dm-crypt key, do not reference LUKS at all.

Milan
