Regarding backporting of 9f6dc633:

My reasoning was that introducing "md->pending_io" in the backported 
stable kernels is useless - it will just degrade performance by consuming 
one more cache line per I/O without providing any gain.

In the upstream kernels, Mike needs that "md->pending_io" variable for 
other reasons (the I/O accounting was reworked there in order to avoid 
some spikes with dm-crypt), but there is no need for it in the stable 
kernels.

In order to fix that race condition, all we need to do is to make sure 
that dm_stats_account_io is called before bio_end_io_acct - and the patch 
does that - it swaps them.

Do you still insist that this useless percpu variable must be added to the 
stable kernels? If you do, I can make it, but I think it's better to just 
swap those two functions.
