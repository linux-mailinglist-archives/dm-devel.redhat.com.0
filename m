Exactly, each disk operates completely independently (so a XFS
partition per disk on each md device). So I have 4 disks presently, 3
are data, and one is dedicated parity. I can scale up or down these
disks freely, changing the physical data disk sizes and still have
them all protected by the single parity disk by removing and adding
them to the array.

Users of these appliances today gain "parity" by adding the second
disk (note it must be the equal to or the largest in the array), and
can scale by adding disk by disk individually (so 3, 4, 5, 6...).

Hopefully it's starting to make more sense now.
