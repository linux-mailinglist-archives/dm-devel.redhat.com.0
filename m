Hi Mimi,
Thanks a lot for your continual engagement and
providing us valuable feedback on this work.

Ok. I will revisit this cover letter again, when we post the next
version of the series. We also need to update the cover letter to
include the description for new patches to be added in this series, as
per your suggestion below. {built-in policy patch (by Lakshmi) and an
example measurement patch (SeLinux by Lakshmi)}

Here, I was attempting to describe the problem (what needs to be
solved), before proposing a solution below. But maybe it is not adding
value. I will get rid of the above paragraph in the next iteration.

Will do.

Makes total sense. Will do.

Yes. I am coordinating with Lakshmi/Raphael on including one of the
examples. (SeLinux as per your feedback)

BTW, we also have one more data source (dm-crypt) currently in review,
that uses critical data measurement infrastructure to measure its kernel
in-memory data.

Thanks again for all the help and support with the patches.
