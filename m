Even though bios cannot get into underlying blk-mq they are already
inflight on behalf of the upper-layer bio-based device. I'll look closer
at the code but it seems like there is potential for the original
device's bios to still be queued to original, past the ->submit_bio
entry, and waiting for blk-mq to unfreeze.  Meaning upon return from
what I _think_ you're saying will be sufficient: DM bio-based device
will carry on submitting IO to the blk-mq device that has since been
interposed.. that IO will _not_ complete in terms of the interposed
device.. so you'll have a split-brain dual completion of IO from the
original bio-based DM device _and_ the interposed device (for any new io
that hits ->submit_bio after the interposed device is in place).

I think you need to have original bio-based DM suspend, interpose
device, and then resume the original.  Anything entering original's
->submit_bio from that point will all get sent to interposed
device. Right?

freeze_bdev/thaw_bdev are only relevant if a filesystem is layered
ontop.  A bio-based DM device can be used directly (by a database or
whatever).

Yes, but you need to suspend before attaching the interposer too, to
flush any in-flight bios that might be in-flight within the various DM
target code.

DM should be able to internalize all this when handling the
DM_INTERPOSE_FLAG during the new table load.  It'd call into
dm_internal_suspend_fast and then dm_internal_resume_fast for the
original md device.
