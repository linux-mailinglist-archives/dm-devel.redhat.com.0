A C-based interface is not sufficient because the layer that must do
provsioning is not guaranteed to be directly under the filesystem.
We must be able to propagate the request down to the layers that
need to provision storage, and that includes hardware devices.

e.g. dm-thin would have to issue REQ_PROVISION on the LBA ranges it
allocates in it's backing device to guarantee that the provisioned
LBA range it allocates is also fully provisioned by the storage
below it....

Keep in mind that "critical FS metadata" in this context is any
metadata which could cause the filesystem to hang or enter a global
error state if an unexpected ENOSPC error occurs during a metadata
write IO.

Which, in pretty much every journalling filesystem, equates to all
metadata in the filesystem. For a typical root filesystem, that
might be a in the range of a 1-200MB (depending on journal size).
For larger filesytems with lots of files in them, it will be in the
range of GBs of space.

Plan for having to support tens of GBs of provisioned space in
filesystems, not tens of MBs....

I think there's a 2-3 solid days of coding to fully implement
REQ_PROVISION support in XFS, including userspace tool support.
Maybe a couple of weeks more to flush the bugs out before it's
largely ready to go.

So if there's buy in from the block layer and DM people for
REQ_PROVISION as described, then I'll definitely have XFS support
ready for you to test whenever dm-thinp is ready to go.

I can't speak for other filesystems, I suspect the only one we care
about is ext4.  btrfs and f2fs don't need dm-thinp and there aren't
any other filesystems that are used in production on top of
dm-thinp, so I think only XFS and ext4 matter at this point in time.

I suspect that ext4 would be fairly easy to add support for as well.
ext4 has a lot more fixed-place metadata than XFS has so much more
of it's metadata is covered by mkfs-time provisioning. Limiting
dynamic metadata to specific fully provisioned block groups and
provisioning new block groups for metadata when they are near full
would be equivalent to how I plan to provision metadata space in
XFS. Hence the implementation for ext4 looks to be broadly similar
in scope and complexity as XFS....
