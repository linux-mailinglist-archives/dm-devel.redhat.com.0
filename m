If there was any discussion, I haven't been involved :-)=A0

I haven't looked into FPIN much so far. I'm rather sceptic with it's
usefulness for dm-multipath. Being a property of FC-2, FPIN works at
least 2 layers below dm-multipath. dm-multipath is agnostic against
protocol and transport properties by design. User space multipathd can
cross these layers and tune dm-multipath based on lower-level
properties, but such actions  have rather large latencies.

As you know, dm-multipath has 3 switches for routing IO via different
paths:

 1 priority groups,
 2 path status (good / failed)
 3 path selector algorithm

1) and 2) are controlled by user space, and have high latency.

The current "marginal" concept in multipathd watches paths for repeated
failures, and configures the kernel to avoid using paths that are
considered marginal, using methods 1) and 2). This is a very-high-
latency algorithm that changes state on the time scale of minutes.
There is no concept for "delaying" or "pausing" IO on paths on short
time scale.

The only low-latency mechanism is 3). But it's block level, no existing
selector looks at transport-level properties.

That said, I can quite well imagine a feedback mechanism based on
throttling or delays applied in the FC drivers. For example, it a
remote port was throttled by the driver in response to FPIN messages,
it's bandwidth would decrease, and a path selector like "service-time"
would automatically assign less IO to such paths. This wouldn't need
any changes in dm-multipath or multipath-tools, it would work entirely
on the FC level.

Talking about improving the current "marginal" algorithm in multipathd,
and knowing that it's slow, FPIN might provide additional data
that would be good to have. Currently, multipathd only has 2 inputs,
"good<->bad" state transitions based either on kernel I/O errors or
path checker results, and failure statistics from multipathd's internal
"io_err_stat" thread, which only reads sector 0. This could obviously
be improved, but there may actually be lower-hanging fruit than
evaluating FPIN notifications (for example, I've pondered utilizing the
kernel's blktrace functionality to detect unusually long IO latencies
or bandwidth drops).

Talking about FPIN, is it planned to notify user space about such
fabric events, and if yes, how?

Thanks,
Martin
