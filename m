OTOH, we take logev_lock in log_safe() anyway (to set
log_messages_pending). I doubt that it makes a big difference if we
take the two locks sequentially, or nested. The previous code actually
took the logev_lock twice, before and after logq_lock. Assuming that
contention is rather rare, I believe my code might actually perform
better than before. 

In your previous review 
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2020-September/msg00631.html
you pointed out that you considered it important that log_safe() works
even after the thread was stopped. Making this work implies that
log_safe() needs to check if the thread is up. So we either have to
take logev_lock twice, or take logq_lock while holding logev_lock.

Bottom line: I think my patch is correct. We could add another patch on
top that moves logq_lock() into log.c, protecting the "la" variable,
but the nesting would still need to be the same.

Does this make sense?

Martin
