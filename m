I meant driver may allocate bio and submit it in current context, and this
allocated bio is for completing FS hipri bio too. So far, HIPRI won't be
set for this bio, but driver may mark this bio as HIPRI and TAG, so this
created bio can be polled.

The io poll context is created when FS HIPRI bio on based queue(DM) is
submitted, at that time, bio based driver's ->submit_bio isn't called
yet. So when bio driver's ->submit_bio() allocates new bios and submits
them in current context, if driver marks this bio as HIPRI and TAG, they
can be polled too.

Poll context shouldn't be created for kernel context.

So far, this patch won't cover bios submitted from kernel context, and
for any bios submitted from kernel context, their HIPRI will be cleared.

But HIPRI won't be set for this allocated bio.

Originally I planed to add new helper of submit_poll_bio() for current
HIPRI uses, and only create poll context in this code path, this way can
decouple REQ_TAG a bit. But looks it is enough to re-use REQ_TAG for this
purpose. If not, it can be quite easy to address issue wrt. creating poll
context.
