Older me still greatly cares :-)

Not sure what Christoph change you are referring to, but all the ones
that I did to improve the init side were all backed by numbers I ran at
that time (and most/all of the commit messages will have that data). So
yes, it is indeed still very noticeable. Maybe not at 100K IOPS, but at
10M on a core it most certainly is.

I'm all for having solid and maintainable code, obviously, but frivolous
bloating of structures and more expensive setup cannot be hand waved
away with "it doesn't matter if we touch 3 or 6 cachelines" because we
obviously have a disagreement on that.
