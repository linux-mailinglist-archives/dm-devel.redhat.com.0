Not particularly about this flag, but it is expensive. Surely looks
cheap when it's just one feature, but there are dozens of them with
limited applicability, default config kernels are already sluggish
when it comes to really fast devices and it's not getting better.
Also, pretty often every of them will add a bunch of extra checks
to fix something of whatever it would be.

So let's add a bit of pragmatism to the picture, if there is just one
user of a feature but it adds overhead for millions of machines that
won't ever use it, it's expensive.

This one doesn't spill yet into paths I care about, but in general
it'd be great if we start thinking more about such stuff instead of
throwing yet another if into the path, e.g. by shifting the overhead
from linear to a constant for cases that don't use it, for instance
with callbacks or bit masks.
