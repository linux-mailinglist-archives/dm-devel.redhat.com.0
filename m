The specific problem is the following:
* There is an thinpool over a physical device
* There are multiple logical volumes over the thin pool
* Each logical volume has an independent file system and an
  independent application running over it
* Each application is potentially allowed to consume the entirety
  of the disk space - there is no strict size limit for application
* Applications need to pre-allocate space sometime, for which
  they use fallocate. Once the operation succeeded, the application
  assumed the space is guaranteed to be there for it.
* Since filesystems on the volumes are independent, filesystem
  level enforcement of size constraints is impossible and the only
  common level is the thin pool, thus, each fallocate has to find its
  representation in thin pool one way or another - otherwise you
  may end up in the situation, where FS thinks it has allocated space
  but when it tries to actually write it, the thin pool is already
  exhausted.
* Hole-Punching fallocate will not reach the thin pool, so the only
  solution presently is zero-writing pre-allocate.
* Not all storage devices support zero-writing efficiently - apart
  from NVMe being or not being capable of doing efficient write
  zero - changing which is easier said than done, and would take
  years - there are also other types of storage devices that do not
  have WRITE ZERO capability in the first place or have it in a
  peculiar way. And adding custom WRITE ZERO to LVM would be
  arguably a much bigger hack.
* Thus, a provisioning block operation allows an interface specific
  operation that guarantees the presence of the block in the
  mapped space. LVM Thin-pool itself is the primary target for our
  use case but the argument is that this operation maps well to
  other interfaces which allow thinly provisioned units.
