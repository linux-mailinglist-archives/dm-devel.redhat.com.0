OK, but afaict the code is identical after your refactoring.
Side-effect is drivers that were double accounting will now be fixed.

Yeah, device-mapper-test-suite (dmts) is a PITA due to ruby dep. And
the tests have gotten a bit stale relative to recent kernels. I'm
aware of this and also about how others would like to see more DM
coverage in blktests. We'll be looking to improve DM testing but it
does always tend to get put on back-burner (but I'll be getting some
help from Ben Marzinski to assess what tests we do have, see where we
have gaps and also put effort to making DM testing part of blktests).

I'm actually now pretty interested to see which (if any) DM tests
would have caught the missing bio checks issue in your initial patch.

That's fair, and as I tried to say in my first reply: I agree it does
clear up that confusion nicely.

Please fold this incremental patch in, with that you can add:
