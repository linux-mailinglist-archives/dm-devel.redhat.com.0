Biggest issue I'm seeing is that block core's bio-based IO submission
implementation really never seriously carried the blk_qc_t changes
through. The cookie return from __submit_bio is thrown away when
recursion occurs in __submit_bio_noacct -- last bio submission's cookie
is what is returned back to caller.  That cookie could be very far
removed from all the others returned earlier in the recursion.

Fixing this would require quite some design and cleanup.

What you detailed there isn't properly modeling what it needs to.
A given dm_target_io could result in quite a few bios (e.g. for
dm-striped we clone each bio for each of N stripes).  So the fan-out,
especially if then stacked on N layers of stacked devices, to all the
various hctx at the lowest layers is like herding cats.

But the recursion in block core's submit_bio path makes that challenging
to say the least.  So much so that any solution related to enabling
proper bio-based IO polling is going to need a pretty significant
investment in fixing block core (storing __submit_bio()'s cookie during
recursion, possibly storing to driver provided memory location,
e.g. DM initialized bio->submit_cookie pointer to a blk_qc_t within a DM
clone bio's per-bio-data).

SO __submit_bio_noacct would become:

   retp =3D &ret;=20
   if (bio->submit_cookie)
          retp =3D bio->submit_cookie;
   *retp =3D __submit_bio(bio);

The lifetime of the bios should be fine given that the cloning nature of
DM requires that all clones complete before the origin may complete.

I think you probably just got caught out by the recursive nature of the bio
submission path -- makes creating a graph of submitted bios and their
associated per-bio-data and generated cookies a mess to track (again,
like herding cats).

Could also be you didn't quite understand the DM code's various
structures.

In any case, the block core changes needed to make bio-based IO polling
work is the main limiting factor right now.

Not sure it is worth the investment... but I could be persuaded to try
harder! ;)

But then once block core is fixed to allow this, we _still_ need to link
all the various 'struct dm_poll_data' structures to allow blk_poll()
to call DM specific method to walk all in the list to calling blk_poll()
for stored cookie and request_queue*, e.g.:

struct dm_poll_data {
       blk_qc_t cookie;
       struct request_queue *queue;
       struct list_head list;
};

Again, it is the recursive nature of submit_bio() that makes this
challenging.
