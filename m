Yes.

Can you suggest a little more specifically what the "dual" is you're
picturing?

Yes, we do have certain ordering requirements in one or two places,
which sort of breaks the mental model of independently processed VIOs.
There are also occasionally non-VIO objects which get queued to invoke
actions on various threads, which I expect might further complicate the
experiment.
