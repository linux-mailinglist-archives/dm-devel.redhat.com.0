Thanks for the explanation.

I believe everyone understands that the fact that the built-in hwtable
in multipath-tools contains sensible defaults for a given storage array
does *not* imply that this array has been tested or officially released
by Netapp (or any storage vendor). If you want, we can add a statement
of this kind (vendor-neutral) to our man page and/or README.

It's also understood that Netapp, like the kernel community, recommends
native multipathing for NVMe, and discourages use of device-mapper
multipath for NVMe devices. Native multipathing is the kernel default,
and must be explicitly disabled either at build time or on the kernel
command line before dm-multipath would even see the devices. IMO it can
be assumed that a user who employs such a setup knows what she's doing,
and is aware that the setup doesn't comply with common recommendations.

Netapp currently publishes configuration recommendations for multipath-
tools with E-Series and NVMe. Xose's patch simply changes the built-in
defaults to match these recommendations. We have been doing this for
years with the intention to improve the "out of the box" experience,
and it's a good thing.

If we didn't take this patch, we'd knowingly force suboptimal default
settings on (admittedly few) users. Who would benefit from that?

We want to ship multipath-tools with the most reasonable defaults that
we are aware of. Xose's continued efforts in this area have been
immensely useful for the community of dm-multipath users. I don't think
we should give this up. I'd like to encourage everyone to continue
submitting improvements for the hardware table.

Regards,
Martin
