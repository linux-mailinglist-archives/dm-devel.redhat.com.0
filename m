...whatever point you were trying to make was so vague that it was
totally uninformative and I completely missed it.

What does "callbacks or bit masks" mean, then, specifically?  How
*exactly* would you solve the problem that Jane is seeking to solve by
using callbacks?

Actually, you know what?  I'm so fed up with every single DAX
conversation turning into a ****storm of people saying NO NO NO NO NO NO
NO NO to everything proposed that I'm actually going to respond to
whatever I think your point is, and you can defend whatever I come up
with.

Errors are infrequent, and since everything is cloud-based and disposble
now, we can replace error handling with BUG_ON().  This will reduce code
complexity, which will reduce code size, and improve icache usage.  Win!

Ok so after userspace calls into pread to access a DAX file, hits the
poisoned memory line and the machinecheck fires, what then?  I guess we
just have to figure out how to get from the MCA handler (assuming the
machine doesn't just reboot instantly) all the way back into memcpy?
Ok, you're in charge of figuring that out because I don't know how to do
that.

Notably, RWF_DATA_RECOVERY is the flag that we're calling *from* a
callback that happens after memory controller realizes it's lost
something, kicks a notification to the OS kernel through ACPI, and the
kernel signal userspace to do something about it.  Yeah, that's dumb
since spinning rust already does all this for us, but that's pmem.
