Do you also rename the package that ships libpathmpersist.so.0 in
this case?

I.e. how do you make this example work:

old libmpathpersist.so.0 provides ABI 1
new libmpathpersist.so.0(?) provides ABI 2

multipathd was linked against the new libmpathpersist.so.0 (ABI 2)
qemu was linked against the old libmpathpersist.so.0 (ABI 1)

I don't see how these can be co-installable if libmpathpersist.so.0
is never renamed?

Maybe other distributions do not need coinstallability, but Debian
needs this, because a) on actual installs we support partial upgrades,
and b) we do not rebuild all reverse-dependencies of a library the
moment a new version of that lib is uploaded.


I also wonder you get from symbol versioning if the old symbols just
disappear. ISTM you could get the same effect - cannot by accident
load the wrong library version - just by bumping the soname, and
ignoring manual symbol versioning?


I asked around a bit and got "this seems very unusual" as feedback.


Thanks,
Chris
