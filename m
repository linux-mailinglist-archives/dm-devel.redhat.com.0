How do you make it robust when there is no locking/serialisation to
prevent overlapping concurrent IO while the copy-offload is in
progress? Or that you don't have overlapping concurrent
copy-offloads running at the same time?

You've basically created a block dev ioctl interface that looks
impossible to use safely. It doesn't appear to be coherent with the
blockdev page cache nor does it appear to have any documented data
integrity semantics, either. e.g. how does this interact with the
guarantees that fsync_bdev() and/or sync_blockdev() are supposed to
provide?

IOWs, if you don't have either CFR or some other strictly bound
kernel user with well defined access, synchronisation and integrity
semantics, how can anyone actually robustly test these ioctls to be
working correctly in all situations they might be called?

Cheers,

Dave.
