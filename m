Is the exception table requirement not already fulfilled by:

sigaction(SIGBUS, &act, 0);
...
if (sigsetjmp(sj_env, 1)) {
...

...but yes, that's awkward when all you want is an error return from a
copy operation.

For _nofault I'll note that on the kernel side Linus was explicit
about not mixing fault handling and memory error exception handling in
the same accessor. That's why copy_mc_to_kernel() and
copy_{to,from}_kernel_nofault() are distinct. I only say that to probe
deeper about what a "copy_mc()" looks like in userspace? Perhaps an
interface to suppress SIGBUS generation and register a ring buffer
that gets filled with error-event records encountered over a given
MMAP I/O code sequence?

Ah, ok, yes, I agree with you there that needing to redirect writes to
a platform firmware call to clear errors, and notify the device that
its error-list has changed is exceedingly awkward. That said, even if
the device-side error-list auto-updated on write (like the promise of
MOVDIR64B) there's still the question about when to do management on
the software error lists in the driver and/or filesytem. I.e. given
that XFS at least wants to be aware of the error lists for block
allocation and "list errors" type features. More below...

Hasn't this been a perennial topic at LSF/MM, i.e. how to get an
interface for the filesystem to request "try harder" to return data?
If the device has a recovery slow-path, or error tracking granularity
is smaller than the I/O size, then RWF_RECOVER_DATA gives the
device/driver leeway to do better than the typical fast path. For
writes though, I can only come up with the use case of this being a
signal to the driver to take the opportunity to do error-list
management relative to the incoming write data.

However, if signaling that "now is the time to update error-lists" is
the requirement, I imagine the @kaddr returned from
dax_direct_access() could be made to point to an unmapped address
representing the poisoned page. Then, arrange for a pmem-driver fault
handler to emulate the copy operation and do the slow path updates
that would otherwise have been gated by RWF_RECOVER_DATA.

Although, I'm not excited about teaching every PMEM arch's fault
handler about this new source of kernel faults. Other ideas?
RWF_RECOVER_DATA still seems the most viable / cleanest option, but
I'm willing to do what it takes to move this error management
capability forward.
