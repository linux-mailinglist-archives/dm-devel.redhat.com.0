Besides caching at the dm layer, there is caching at the filesystem
layer (files, directories and other stuff).  The caching at the DM
layer is not the issue.

If rootfs mounts the dm-device someplace as a
(ntfs)filesystem(readonly), and then later you also mount that same
(ntfs)filesystem (read-write) someplace then you have mounted the
filesystem twice (not a shared bind mount that appears to be 2 mounts
but in reality is only a single mount), and the filesystem code is not
safe when there are 2 unique separate mount instances, the fs caching
is not shared.

ie if the filesystem is already mounted as a filesystem someplace
(mapping a dm device is not mounting) and you mount it a 2nd time then
you are at risk of corruption.

For the mount command to get a busy indicates that something has
already mounted it someplace and has locked the device(to prevent a
2nd corrupting mount from happening), and the entire purpose of the
module appears to be to disable the safety provided by this locking
and allow one to mount the fs again.

And note that with double mounts (usually I have seen/debugged the
crash/ouage from them with shared SAN storage)  they can "APPEAR" to
kind of work if you do not use them too much, but eventually the 2
instances of filesystem code step on each other and it ends badly
(kernel crash, data corruption, loss of the filesystem).

If you need this module so that you can use another (non-bind) mount
command someplace on the same device then you are double mounting.
The point of the busy device is that it is mounted someplace, and the
entire point of the module is to bypass the protection.

It is the filesystem code and filesystem caching that is not safe.
Both filesystems assume they have total control of filesystem data
structures, and at the very least the mount writing will change those
structures, and if the read-only mount may read blocks that were part
of one file but now aren't part of that file returning the wrong data.
