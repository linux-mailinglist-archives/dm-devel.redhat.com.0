Great, I'm glad to hear that.  Obviously this is still in the early days and
we're talking about high-level ABI design here, so things are almost certainly
going to change, but it's always good to have people pushing on stuff.

Just be warned: we've only had two people write userspaces for this (one of
which was me, and all that is test code) so I'd be shocked if you manage to
avoid running into bugs.
