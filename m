Thanks for clarifying. Wasn't aware of XFS delalloc's "wet finger in
the air" ;)

So do you think it reasonable to require applications to fallocate
their data files? Unaware if users are aware to take that extra step.

Do you think you're OK to scope out, and/or implement, the XFS changes
if you use v7 of this patchset as the starting point? (v8 should just
be v7 minus the dm-thin.c and dm-snap.c changes).  The thinp
support in v7 will work enough to allow XFS to issue REQ_OP_PROVISION
and/or fallocate (via mkfs.xfs) to dm-thin devices.

And Joe and I can make independent progress on the dm-thin.c changes
needed to ensure the REQ_OP_PROVISION gaurantee you need.

Thanks,
Mike
