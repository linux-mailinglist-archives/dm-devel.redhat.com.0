Hi Peter

In rhel, we have a rhel only udev rule that checks
DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG. Maybe it's the reason why you don't
notice this. Besides DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG, it still checks
other flags.

# Next make sure that this isn't a dm device we should skip for some reason
ENV{DM_UDEV_RULES_VSN}!="?*", GOTO="dm_change_end"
ENV{DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG}=="1", GOTO="dm_change_end"
ENV{DM_SUSPENDED}=="1", GOTO="dm_change_end"
KERNEL=="dm-*", SUBSYSTEM=="block", ENV{ID_FS_TYPE}=="linux_raid_member", \
        ACTION=="change", RUN+="/sbin/mdadm -I $env{DEVNAME}"
LABEL="dm_change_end"

In 10-dm.rules, if DM_SUSPENDED is 1, it sets
DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG to 1. So we don't need the check of
DM_SUSPENDED. But how DM_UDEV_RULES_VSN? Do we need to check it?

Best Regards
Xiao
