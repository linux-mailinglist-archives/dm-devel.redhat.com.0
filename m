The dm-snapshot code requires careful order of operations.  You say you
removed the origin target.. please show exactly what you did.  Your 4th
patch shouldn't be tied to this patchset. Can be dealt with
independently.

Why? Those hooks are inherently more constrained.  And in the case of
resume, failure is not an option.

I'm struggling to see why you need "[interpose]" (never mind that this
idea of device options is a new construct): what are the implications?
Are you saying that a table will have N devices with only a subset that
are interposed?

Just feels very awkward but I'll try to keep an open mind until I can
better understand.

>   * Fix origin_map() then o->split_binary value is zero.

Overall this effort, while appreciated in general, is getting more and
more muddled -- you're having to sprinkle obscure code all over DM. And
your patch headers are severely lacking for a v8 patch
submission. Terse bullet points don't paint a very comprehensive
picture. Please detail how a user is expected to drive this (either in
patch headers and/or some Documentation file).
