Yes, absolutely! We definitely have plans to support namespaces in the future.
However, it's worth mentioning that there are other tasks that we may need
to prioritize due to their relatively lower complexity. For example, before
we can fully implement namespaces, we need to address some other important
aspects of the system, such as adding a policy language for integrity
enforcement on configuration files and defining trusted certificates
that can sign the root hash. Therefore, the timeline for implementing
namespaces will depend on the completion time of these tasks.

I understand your concerns, and we can proceed with a single policy design
for the initial version.
