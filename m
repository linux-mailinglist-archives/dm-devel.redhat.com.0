As this patchset nears the point of being "ready for merge" and DM's
"zoned" oriented targets are multiplying, I need to understand: where
are we collectively going?  How long are we expecting to support the
"stop-gap zoned storage" layers we've constructed?

I know https://zonedstorage.io/docs/introduction exists... but it
_seems_ stale given the emergence of ZNS and new permutations of zoned
hardware. Maybe that isn't quite fair (it does cover A LOT!) but I'm
still left wanting (e.g. "bring it all home for me!")...

Damien, as the most "zoned storage" oriented engineer I know, can you
please kick things off by shedding light on where Linux is now, and
where it's going, for "zoned storage"?

To give some additional context to help me when you answer: I'm left
wondering what, if any, role dm-zoned has to play moving forward given
ZNS is "the future" (and yeah "the future" is now but...)?  E.g.: Does
it make sense to stack dm-zoned ontop of dm-po2zoned!?

Yet more context: When I'm asked to add full-blown support for
dm-zoned to RHEL my gut is "please no, why!?".  And if we really
should add dm-zoned is dm-po2zoned now also a requirement (to support
non-power-of-2 ZNS devices in our never-ending engineering of "zoned
storage" compatibility stop-gaps)?

In addition, it was my understanding that WDC had yet another zoned DM
target called "dm-zap" that is for ZNS based devices... It's all a bit
messy in my head (that's on me for not keeping up, but I think we need
a recap!)

So please help me, and others, become more informed as quickly as
possible! ;)

Thanks,
Mike

ps. I'm asking all this in the open on various Linux mailing lists
because it doesn't seem right to request a concall to inform only
me... I think others may need similar "zoned storage" help.
