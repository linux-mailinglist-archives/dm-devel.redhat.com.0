Please explain. What bug would that be, in what subsystem?=A0It takes=20
time until a dm-triggered CHANGE event makes its way through the udev
event queue and completes rules processing. That's perfectly normal.

I say the bug is in this udev rule file. The set of properties and
symlinks of a systemd-managed device must not change when new uevents
for this device are processed, unless absolutely necessary. The current
rule violates this principle: If a device that contains a file system
is suspended, it continues to contain this file system, and the by-uuid
symlink for the file system should be preserved.

You can easily test this. Check the set of symlinks for a partition on
a multipath device, suspend the device, run "udevadm trigger -c add" on
the device (simulating coldplug), and check the set of symlinks again.
You'll see that by-uuid or by-label links will be lost and will now
point to one of the map's paths. These symlinks are crucial for
mounting file systems. With my patch, the symlinks are preserved.

That's how device identification and activation with udev and systemd
works. It won't change any time soon. Explain on which grounds you're
calling it "somewhat doomed".

I wouldn't call it "minor" if a system fails to boot. The time window
when this is possible is indeed small. But it's not zero, and that's
why this issue occurs.

Nothing bad happens. The device is mounted or scanned just fine.

I've personally had a part in fixing multiple race conditions both
multipathd and udev.=A0Ben Marzinski and I recently worked on dropping
the dependency of multipathd.service on udev-settle.service. That
accellerates booting and is conceptually cleaner than before, but it
reveals bugs in other parts of the system, like this one.

As long as you don't explain what logic you mean, this is a hard
question to answer.

> There should be no race when switching from ramdisk to rootfs.

I agree that there *should* not be any. But there is one, and this
patch fixes it.

I would appreciate if you said what's actually wrong my patch. So far
you haven't. You just speculated about errors in other parts of the
system. Are you saying my patch would cause regressions or errors? If
yes, how would that come to pass, for which devices, and under which
conditions?

Martin
