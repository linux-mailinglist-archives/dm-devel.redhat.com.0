What is the difference between bio_set_pos and bio_rewind()? Both have
to restore bio->bi_iter(the sector part and the bvec part).

Also how to update ->bi_done which 'counts bytes advanced'? You meant doing it in
very bio_advance()? then no, why do we have to pay the cost for very unusual
bio_rewind()?

Or if I misunderstood your point, please cook a patch and I am happy to
take a close look, and posting one very raw idea with random data
structure looks not helpful much for this discussion technically.
