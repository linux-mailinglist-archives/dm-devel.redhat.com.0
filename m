Ok, maybe it is necessary to specify better the scope of IPE, why the
current implementation can be considered as complete.

If we say, IPE can only allow/deny operations on system components with
immutable security properties, clearly memfd as a component cannot
fullfill this goal due to the non-immutability. This would apply to any
component allowing modifications.

How to address this? What is the immutable property then?

In the case of memfd, intuitively, a useful property for integrity
could be for example that the content can be accessed/modified by only
one process. No other (possibly malicious) processes can tamper with
that file.

So, it is true, to make this property immutable more hooks are needed.
But should it be something that IPE does? Or it should be done by an
external component (another LSM) that does the enforcement and reports
to IPE that the property is true? Theoretically (with a proper policy),
existing LSMs could be used for that purpose too.

I would say more the second, it should not be IPE job, so that IPE can
exclusively focus on evaluating properties, not making sure that the
properties are immutable.
