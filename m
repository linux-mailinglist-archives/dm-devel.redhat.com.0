A better name still eludes me, but I'll definitely at least comment it better

I didn't want to replace the original blk_keyslot_manager because it's
possible that e.g. fscrypt is checking for crypto capabilities support
via blk_ksm_crypto_cfg_supported() when DM wants to replace the
blk_keyslot_manager. DM would have to free the memory used by the
blk_keyslot_manager, but blk_ksm_crypto_cfg_supported() might still
be trying to access that memory. I did it this way to avoid having to
add refcounts or something else to the blk_keyslot_manager...(And I
didn't bother adding any synchronization code since the capabilities
only ever expand, and never contract).

table_load() only calls dm_setup_md_queue() on initial table load (when
the md_type is DM_TYPE_NONE), so I can't call
dm_verify_inline_encryption() in only dm_setup_md_queue(), because
dm_verify_inline_encryption() needs to run on every table load.

Ah I totally forgot blk_ksm_destroy() doesn't free the memory used by
the ksm (not anymore at least, I'm getting confused by the numerous
revisions that code went through) - I'll need to fix that everywhere.

If we call it from dm_swap_table(), we could have it pass the returned
ksm to __bind(), either as a new argument, or by adding the ksm to the
queue_limits (I'll have to check if that's ok/a good idea in the first
place), and __bind() could send the argument to
dm_table_set_restrictions()

But the real issue is, I think we should check whether a new table is
valid (from the ksm capabilities support perspective) at the time that
table is loaded (as opposed to only checking it when DM attempts to swap
it in, which might be a lot later, when the user resumes the device) - so
I can't only call it from dm_setup_md_queue(), and I'd have to call it
from table_load() anyway. And the returned ksm that table_load() obtains
from dm_init_inline_encryption() can't really be used - because
1) the ksm constructed at dm_swap_table() might actually support more
capabilities than the ksm constructed in table_load(), because
underlying devices might get resumed, and have new tables swapped in,
and might support more capabilities than before
2) a subsequent dm_swap_table() call could fail for whatever reason, and
we'll need to revert to the current ksm.

What I'm doing right now is simply freeing the ksm returned by
dm_init_inline_encryption() whenever it's called from table_load()
(and I'm trying to make that process a little nicer by wrapping it in a
function called dm_verify_inline_encryption()) - so if we're going to
have to call dm_init_inline_encryption() and then freeing the returned
ksm in table_load(), I think it might be better to continue to have
dm_verify_inline_encryption(), unless you'd prefer just open coding the
function directly.

Yeah, I really wanted to do that too, but as I addressed above, I don't
think it's that straightforward :(

Thanks, will address this everywhere I call blk_ksm_destroy().

Alright, I'll move the call to dm_init_inline_encryption() earlier, into
dm_swap_table().

I'm calling blk_ksm_destroy() from __bind() wihout any ifdefs, so I
think it's necessary - I'll check again just in case.
