Thanks for the quick response! I thought the take-home message of the
referenced is we shouldn't leave the master key in the user space. Sorry 
I seem to still misunderstand what's mentioned in the referenced mail. But
take AES as an example, my reasoning is as follows:
   the expanded key has already been stored in "struct crypto_aes_ctx".
   If a hacker can somehow access the master key stored in the memory
   reserved exclusively for kdump, it means he/she can also access the
   expanded key stored in struct crypto_aes_ctx. So  not creating
   another attack vector?

Sorry, I haven't explained how kdump works. Once the 1st kernel crashes and
the system boots into the kdump kernel, the kdump kernel only have direct
access to the memory exclusively reserved for it i.e. the kdump kernel
loses the direct access to the keyring constructed in the 1st kernel. In
theory, the kdump kernel could do some "hacking" to find out the key
stored in the memory directly managed by the 1st kernel but I imagine
this would be difficult task (imagine I present the memory dump of my
computer to you and ask you to rebuild all the relevant kernel data
structures and find the key). Besides, it's not reliable to read the
memory directly managed by the first kernel for example the memory could
be corrupt. So we have to pass the master key from the 1st kernel to the kdump
kernel.

Btw, if we store the key in the kernel keyring, doesn't it mean storing the
"encryption key to another place" and thus creating "another attach vector"?

Thanks for pointing out my mistake of misusing the word LUKS! I'll fix this
error once we settle down what's the correct approach to reuse master
key for the kdump kernel.
