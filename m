Thanks for clarification. I am aware that something like this can be 
done. But I did not think that is would be necessary to explicitly 
disable barriers, or should I more accurately write cache flushes, in 
such a case:

I thought that nowadays a cache flush would be (almost) a no-op in the 
case the storage receiving it is backed by such reliability measures. 
I.e. that the hardware just says "I am ready" when having the I/O 
request in stable storage whatever that would be, even in case that 
would be battery backed NVRAM and/or temporary flash.

At least that is what I thought was the background for not doing the 
"nobarrier" thing anymore: Let the storage below decide whether it is 
safe to basically ignore cache flushes by answering them (almost) 
immediately.

However, not sending the cache flushes in the first place would likely 
still be more efficient although as far as I am aware block layer does not 
return back a success / failure information to the upper layers anymore 
since kernel 2.6.37.

Seems I got to update my Linux Performance tuning slides about this once 
again.

Hmm, right.

I now wonder why XFS people deprecated and even removed those mount 
options. But maybe I better ask them separately instead of adding their 
list in CC. Probably by forwarding this mail to the XFS mailing list 
later on.
