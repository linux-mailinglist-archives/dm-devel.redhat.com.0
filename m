these images can be treated as if all their files are missing and the
checksum is calculated on the receiver side.  They will still be stored
locally indexed by their checksum.  We lose the possibility to pull only
the missing files but we maintain the other advantages at runtime.  In
this way moving to a new format can be done incrementally without
breaking what we have now.
