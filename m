I think the only way the FC drivers can respond to this is by delaying
the R_RDY primitives resulting in less credits being available for the
remote side to use. That only works on a link layer and not fabric
wide. It cannot change linkspeed at all as that would bounce a port
resulting in all sorts of state changes. That being said this is
already the existing behavior and not really tied to fpins. The goal of
the fpin method was to provide a more proactive method and inform the
OS layer of fabric issues so it could act upon it by adjusting the IO
profile.

I think this should all be done in kernel space as we're talking sub-
millisecond timings here when it comes to fpins and the reaction time
expected. I may be wrong but I'll leave that up to you.

Would it be possible to piggyback on the service time path selector in
this when it pertains latency? =C2=A0

Another thing is that at some stage the IO queueing decision needs to
take into account the various different FPIN descriptors. A remote
delivery notification due to slow drain behaviour is very different
than ISL congestion or any physical issues.

This is a bit of a reactive approach that should be a secondary
objective. Having been in storage/fc support for 20 years I know that
most admins are not really responsive to this and taking actions based
on event entries take a very very long time. From an operations
perspective any sort of manual action should be avoided as much as
possible.

I think the only way the FC drivers can respond to this is by delaying the =
R_RDY primitives resulting in less credits being available for the remote s=
ide to use. That only works on a link layer and not fabric wide. It cannot =
change linkspeed at all as that would bounce a port resulting in all sorts =
of state changes. That being said this is already the existing behavior and=
 not really tied to fpins. The goal of the fpin method was to provide a mor=
e proactive method and inform the OS layer of fabric issues so it could act=
 upon it by adjusting the IO profile.</div><blockquote type=3D"cite" style=
