With RHEL-9 and going forward, RHEL is recommending and defaulting to
using native multipathing for NVMe devices over dm-multipathing. That
means that people who use dm-multipath for these devices will already
actively be making the decision to not use the recommended settings.

We don't make any claims that the multipath.conf defaults have any
official support. We have always included default configs that have no
official blessing from their vendors. The goal is to give the average
user a good starting point for configuring their system.  If you do have
an official recommened dm-multipath configuration, we will certainly use
that. But if there simply isn't any recommended config because you don't
recommend that people use dm-multipath, then I don't see the harm in
providing "reasonable defaults" (as the multipath.conf man page calls
them) to the users that make the choice to use dm-multipath for NVMe
devices.
