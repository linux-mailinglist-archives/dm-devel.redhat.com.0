Is it just because dm-kcopyd supports async copy? If yes, I believe we
can reply on io_uring for implementing async copy_file_range, which will
be generic interface for async copy, and could get better perf.

Got it, but IMO the check in generic_copy_file_checks() can be
relaxed to cover blkdev cause splice does support blkdev.

Then your bdev offload copy work can be simplified into:

1) implement .copy_file_range for def_blk_fops, suppose it is
blkdev_copy_file_range()

2) inside blkdev_copy_file_range()

- if the bdev supports offload copy, just submit one bio to the device,
and this will be converted to one pt req to device

- otherwise, fallback to generic_copy_file_range()

BTW, that is probably one direction of ublk's async zero copy IO too.
