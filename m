This is not true. Imagine blkid that tries to read various superblocks on disk
and do decisions based on it (UUID links etc). These can be in "unused" sectors.

In the normal situation dm-integrity stops the read, because checksum is wrong.
Now it seems that it returns these random data. This is not integrity protection at all.

Maybe I am missing something, but I would say this is a wrong behavior and it should
be reverted. I think this should be not supported even with additional switch,
to me is it really against the principle of sector-level integrity protection.

Also, I added wiping to integritysetup because some tools (like mkfs) actually
needef to read unitialized data before creating metadata - so without previous wipe it failed.
(These are bugs in the tools, obviously: I plan to report these  unfortunately it never happened.
Dunno if it is still the case.)

Sorry for the late reply.
