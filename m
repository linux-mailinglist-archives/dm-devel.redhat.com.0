Yeah, just for reference, I saw this happening in practice when
something with the LU mapping changed on IBM storage - IIRC I saw it
with capacity changes. You end up in this code in the kernel:
    https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree=
/drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c?id=3D92bf22614b21a2706f4993b278017e437f7785b3#n4=
16

And from there you ought to get an uevent for the sdev.

The WWID in sysfs might still be wrong though AFAIK. The kernel seems to
ignore the UA after it delivered the uevent.
