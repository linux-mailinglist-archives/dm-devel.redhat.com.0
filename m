Well, currently you click some "Eject / safely remove / whatever" button
and then you get a "wait" dialog until everything is done after which
you're told the stick is safe to remove. What I imagine is that the "wait"
dialog needs to be there while there are any (or exclusive at minimum) open=
ers
of the device. Not until umount(2) syscall has returned. And yes, the
kernel doesn't quite make that easy - the best you can currently probably
do is to try opening the device with O_EXCL and if that fails, you know
there's some other exclusive open.

You seem to be concentrated too much on the simple case of a desktop with
an USB stick you just copy data to & from. :) The trouble is, as Al wrote
elsewhere in this thread that filesystem unmount can be for example a
result of exit(2) or close(2) system call if you setup things in a nasty
way. Do you want exit(2) to fail because the block device is frozen?
Umount(2) has to work for all its users and changing the behavior has nasty
corner-cases. So does the current behavior, I agree, but improving
situation for one usecase while breaking another usecase isn't really a way
forward...

Well, the filesystem (struct superblock to be exact) is invisible in
/proc/mounts (or whatever), that is true. But it is still very much
associated with that block device and if you do 'mount <device>
<mntpoint>', you'll get it back. But yes, the filesystem will not go away
until all references to it are dropped and you cannot easily find who holds
those references and how to get rid of them.

This option was also discussed in the past and it has nasty consequences as
well. Cleanly shutting down a filesystem usually needs to write to the
underlying device so either you allow the filesystem to write to the device
on umount breaking assumptions of the user who froze the fs or you'd have
to implement a special handling for this case for every filesystem to avoid
the writes (and put up with the fact that the filesystem will appear as
uncleanly shutdown on the next mount). Not particularly nice either...
