Hi Guilherme,

I'm glad this work interests you and thanks for sharing your thoughts!

I believe some users have security concern for where to save vmcore.
This use case exactly fits your description and your proposed solution
shall be good for this type of users. But I think many more users may
just choose to encrypt the hard drive when installing the system and
they would naturally expect kdump to work for the case of full disk
encryption. So your proposed solution may not address the latter case 
where there is a much large user base.
