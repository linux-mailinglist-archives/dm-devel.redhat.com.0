Yes I see that now.  But it also served to preserve the original bio
for use in completion.  Not a big deal, but it did track the head of
the bio_chain.

The bigger issue with this patch is that you've caused
dm_submit_bio_remap() to go back to accounting the entire original bio
before any split occurs.  That is a problem because you'll end up
accounting that bio for every split, so in split heavy workloads the
IO accounting won't reflect when the IO is actually issued and we'll
regress back to having very inaccurate and incorrect IO accounting for
dm_submit_bio_remap() heavy targets (e.g. dm-crypt).
