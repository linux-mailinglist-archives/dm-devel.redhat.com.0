Hello Martin,

>From a transport side an example would be an Ethernet Pause or with
Infiniband there is also an ECN (Explicit Congestion Notification) and
I'm sure there may be others for other transport mechanisms.=C2=A0
https://cva.stanford.edu/classes/ee382c/research/infiniband_cong.pdf

I don't know how much of these are currently being used in other parts
of the stack but I think that when a modular approach can be created
with a common set of configuration options from a multipathd level you
would seriously do the entire Linux and Storage sysadmin ecosystem a
huge favour.

I would need to dive into the stacks or seek help from the maintainers
of these code-bases to know more of what the options are.

Cheers
Erwin
