So unless I'm really misreading the code - entirely possible - the
umount of the bind-mount now waits until the filesystem is resumed with
your patch. And if that's the case that's a bug.

If at all, then only the last umount, the one that destroys the
superblock, should wait for the filesystem to become unfrozen.

A bind-mount shouldn't as there are still active mounts of the
filesystem (e.g., /mnt/test).

So you should see this with (unless I really misread things):

#!/bin/sh -ex
modprobe brd rd_size=4194304
vgcreate vg /dev/ram0
lvcreate -L 16M -n lv vg
mkfs.ext4 /dev/vg/lv

mount -t ext4 /dev/vg/lv /mnt/test
mount --bind /mnt/test /opt
mount --make-private /opt

dmsetup suspend /dev/vg/lv

umount /opt # This will hang with your patch?

So? Or you might hang at anytime.

Yes, I'm aware.

For device mapper initiated freezes you can unfreeze independent of any
filesystem mountpoint via dm ioctls.
