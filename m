Blk-mq has already implemented queue freezing semantics, even without
this 'grabbing two refcount'. So is this just for the code consisdency
with the bio-based queue?

OK.

Yes. I ignored that the refcount grabbed in the entry of bio submission
has been returned back when the submission completes for bio-based queue.

Not actually.

blk_poll(struct request_queue *q, blk_qc_t cookie, bool spin)
 	struct blk_mq_hw_ctx *hctx;
 	long state;

-	if (!blk_qc_t_valid(cookie) || !blk_queue_poll(q))
+	if (!blk_queue_poll(q) || (queue_is_mq(q) && !blk_qc_t_valid(cookie)))

Here QUEUE_FLAG_POLL is still checked in blk_poll() for bio-based queue,
at least in your latest patch for bio-based polling.
