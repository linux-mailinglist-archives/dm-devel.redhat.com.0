Hello Muneendra, benjamin,

The fpin options that are developed do have a whole plethora of options
and do not mainly trigger paths being in a marginal state. Th mpio
layer could utilise the various triggers like congestion and latency
and not just use a marginal state as a decisive point. If a path is
somewhat congested the amount of io's dispersed over these paths could
just be reduced by a flexible margin depending on how often and which
fpins are actually received. If for instance and fpin is recieved that
an upstream port is throwing physical errors you may exclude is
entirely from queueing IO's to it. If it is a latency related problem
where credit shortages come in play you may just need to queue very
small IO's to it. The scsi CDB will tell the size of the IO. Congestion
notifications may just be used for potentially adding an artificial=C2=A0
delay to reduce the workload on these paths and schedule them on
another.

Not really sure what the possibilities are from a DM-Multipath
viewpoint, but I feel if the OS options are not properly aligned with
what the FC protocol and HBA drivers are able to provide we may miss a
good opportunity to optimize the dispersion of IO's and improve overall
performance.=C2=A0

Regards,
Erwin
