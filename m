In our ecosystem, the OTA generation and on-device application process
has evolved continually, in every release, for over 10 years now. So
we think it's unlikely that we'll stop making improvements to it. Our
current roadmap has other changes in the pipeline too. It's not just
us trying to eek out diminishing returns. Other parts of the system
change around us, and the OTA system needs to adapt.

The performance penalty is something we've been working on, and have
improved a lot since our first iteration. We're currently
experimenting with io_uring as well.

Best,

-David
