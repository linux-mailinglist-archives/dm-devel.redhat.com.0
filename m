Some users are like that, sure. But if that was generally true, we
wouldn't need to adapt our defaults, because everyone would copy the
configs from the vendor manuals.

The problem is that the prioritizer was explicitly set to "alua".
Therefore multipathd warns, because the configured setting couldn't be
applied. We could just drop that line, alua would still be selected by
the autodetection if it was supported, and the message wouldn't be
printed any more otherwise. Setting "multibus" explicitly isn't
necessary.

Can we agree on that?

That would be for Ben to fix ;-)
