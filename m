Sounds good. That we can do. We will add a new patch for this.

Essentially yes.. I mean adding the F2FS logic and potentially some
helpers to the block layer to aid GC.

Exactly. Looking at some of the code posted through time and recalling
the discussions at LSF/MM, seems like there are a number of things we
are not addressing here that could be incorporated down the road, such
as dedicated syscalls / extensions, multi namespace / device support,
etc.
