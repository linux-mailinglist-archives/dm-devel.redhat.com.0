Yeah, that's a good question. The ones that have a problem all make
assumptions about a bio's bv_offset being logical block size aligned,
and each of those is accounted for here. Everything else looks fine with
respect to handling offsets.

I don't think we can this particular limit issue. A lot of drivers and
devices can use a smaller dma_alignment than the logical block size, so
the generic block layer wouldn't really know the driver's intentions for
the relationship of these limits.
