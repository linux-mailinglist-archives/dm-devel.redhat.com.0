The problem is handling of 'suspended' state in udev rules - as I've mentioned 
original no userland tool should mostly care about this.

However since there are those things like udev 'trigger' and it would be kind 
of ugly if the 'left-over' suspended device would stop whole system operation
it's most likely better ATM to have some kind of support for this.

It's should be noted there is still 'race' risk of system freezing in the case 
the suspend happens just after sysfs test and before actual i.e. 'blkid' use.
But let's assume the chance of having this to happen is pretty minimal, and 
usually tools doing suspend & resume will work correctly and the 'crash' will 
not likely happen in this particular moment - and suspended device just 
hanging there already for longer time.

The missed issue to be solve is - that ALL rules have to rely on a single 
suspend check - otherwise we risk 'partial' processing  which is the last 
thing we want to see (aka all or nothing).

Your real problem was not the suspend on its own - which still may happen 
anytime (so i.e. just after the test whether device is suspended),
but the bug was related to bad exit path cleaning udev db content in this case 
- which is clear bug.  Next bug is that other rules have to be consistent and 
properly skip its processing if the 1st. rules decides its meant to be skipped.

ATM your patch is already upstream and great thanks for pointing this out.

Regards

Zdenek
