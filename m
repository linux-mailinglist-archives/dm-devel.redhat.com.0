I probably wasn't clear in that reply :(. So the request_queue isn't
responsible for setting up the ksm - setting up the ksm in the request
queue is the responsibility of the DM device.

What I tried doing in the next version that I just sent out was to get
the DM device to set up the ksm as appropriate on table swaps (and also
to verify the "new" ksm on table swaps and loads, so that we reject any
new table that would require a new ksm that would drop any capabability
that the current ksm supports)

This is what the new version of the series does :). It also just sets up
the ksm directly in md->queue, and completely drops the md->ksm field
(because unless I'm misunderstanding things, each DM device is
associated with exactly one queue).

Btw, the new version is at
