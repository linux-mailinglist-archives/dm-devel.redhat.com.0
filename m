Hi, thanks for review this project that I think is very useful and I 
hope it will be able to reach a very good quality, that will be 
integrated into the kernel and that more backup solutions will use it 
improving backups on linux in several cases.
In the last month Sergei made big changes, applying Christoph Hellwig 
changes and working following the received replies, the new version of 
the patch is not ready yet but the many changes done for now are 
available here: https://github.com/SergeiShtepa/linux/commits/blksnap-master
I suppose that full review now of v2 when many things was already 
changed for next version can risk to waste time. I hope I've helped with 
this, if I haven't, sorry to have bother you.
