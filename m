If we encounter a broken VPD entry, IMO we can't continue reading
further entries, because if the entry is broken, we can't trust the
length value which is part of the entry. We may be reading total junk
if we follow it.

We might simply discard the broken entry, stop iterating over the
designators, see if we got a usable designator up to that point (i.e.,
previously), and if yes, use that entry, printing a big fat warning.=A0
That means we'd ultimately fail only if there was no usable designator
before the broken one.

Would you prefer that strategy?

Martin
