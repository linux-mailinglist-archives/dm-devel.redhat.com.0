DM thinp falls into this category but as you detailed it can be made
to work reliably. To carry that forward we need to first establish
the REQ_PROVISION primitive (with this series).

Follow-on associated dm-thinp enhancements can then serve as reference
for how to take advantage of XFS's ability to operate reliably of
thinly provisioned storage.

Happy to implement this in dm-thinp.  Each thin block will need a bit
to say if the block must be REQ_PROVISION'd at time of snapshot (and
the resulting block will need the same bit set).

Walking all blocks of a thin device and triggering REQ_PROVISION for
each will obviously make thin snapshot creation take more time.

I think this approach is better than having a dedicated bitmap hooked
off each thin device's metadata (with bitmap being copied and walked
at the time of snapshot). But we'll see... I'll get with Joe to
discuss further.

Yes, let's finally _do_ this! ;)
