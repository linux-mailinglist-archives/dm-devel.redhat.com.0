Thanks for the extra context, but a _big_ elephant in the room for
this line of discussion is that: the Linux workqueue code has
basically always been only available for use by GPL'd code.  Given
VDO's historic non-GPL origins, it seems _to me_ that an alternative
to Linux's workqueues had to be created to allow VDO to drive its
work.  While understandable, I gave guidance 6 years ago that VDO
engineering should work to definitively reconcile if using Linux
workqueues viable now that VDO has been GPL'd.

But it appears there wasn't much in the way of serious effort put to
completely converting to using Linux workqueues.  That is a problem
because all of the work item strategy deployed by VDO is quite
bespoke.  I don't think the code lends itself to being properly
maintained by more than a 1 or 2 engineers (if we're lucky at this
point).

And while I appreciate that the prospect of _seriously_ converting
over to using Linux workqueues is itself destabilizing and challenging
effort: it seems that it needs to be done to legitimately position the
code to go upstream.

I would like to see a patch crafted that allows branching between the
use of Linux and VDO workqueues. Initially have a dm-vdo modparam
(e.g. use_vdo_wq or vice-versa: use_linux_wq).  And have a wrapping
interface and associated data struct(s) that can bridge between work
being driven/coordinated by either (depending on disposition of
modparam).

This work isn't trivial, I get that. But it serves to clearly showcase
shortcomings, areas for improvement, while pivoting to more standard
Linux interfaces that really should've been used from VDO's inception.

Is this work that you feel you could focus on with urgency?

Thanks,
Mike
