A while ago, I had looked into adding an ioctl to set a default key for a b=
lock
device.  There were a few things that led me to choose a dm target instead.=
  I'm
not sure how many of these are still relevant, but these are what I conside=
red:

* The block device for a partition doesn't have its own request_queue or
  queue_limits; those are properties of the disk, not the partition.  But,
  setting an encryption key may require changes to the queue_limits.  For
  example, discard_zeroes_data will no longer work, and the logical_block_s=
ize
  will need to become the crypto data unit size which may be larger than th=
e
  original logical_block_size.

* The block_device for a given partition didn't stay around while no one ha=
s it
  opened or mounted.  This may have been addressed by Christoph's changes l=
ast
  year that merged block_device and hd_struct, but this used to be an issue=
.

* There was some issue caused by the way the block layer maps partitions to
  disks; the knowledge of the original block device (and thus the key) was =
lost
  at this point.  I'm not sure whether this is still an issue or not.

* A block device ioctl to set a key would need to handle cases where the bl=
ock
  device is already open (fail with EBUSY?), or already has pages cached in=
 the
  pagecache (invalidate them?).  A dm target avoids these concerns since a =
key
  would only be set up when the disk and block device are originally create=
d.

Finally, there's also the fact that this would really be more than "setting=
 a
default key".  To precisely specify the encryption format, you also have to
specify the algorithm, the key type, and the data unit size.  (Also potenti=
ally
more details about IV generation, if blk-crypto ever starts to support more=
 IV
generation methods, which I'd like to avoid but it might eventually happen.=
)

These could all be passed in an ioctl, but dm-crypt already has a syntax de=
fined
for specifying encryption formats.  So it could make sense to reuse it.

Also as Israel indicated, people will want support for Linux keyring keys a=
s an
alternative to raw keys.  A new ioctl could support this, though dm-crypt
already has a defined way to specify such keys.

If all these issues can be solved, then I'd be fine with the block device i=
octl.
