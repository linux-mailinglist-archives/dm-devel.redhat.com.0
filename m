hi Dave,

> This really sounds like broken hardware, not a kernel problem.

It is indeed a hardware issue, specifically the intel qat crypto
driver that's in-tree - the hardware is fine (see below). The IQAT
eratta documentation states that if a request is not submitted
properly it can stall the entire device. The remediation guidance from
2020 was "don't do that" and "don't allow unprivileged users access to
the device". The in-tree driver is not implemented properly either for
this SoC or board - I'm thinking it's related to QATE-7495.

> This implies a dmcrypt level problem - XFS can't make progress is dmcrypt is not completing IOs.

That's the weird part about it. Some bio's are completing, others are
completely dropped, with some stalling forever. I had to use
xfs_repair to get the volumes operational again. I lost a good deal of
files and had to recover from backup after toggling the device back on
on a production system (silly, I know).

> Where are the XFS corruption reports that the subject implies is occurring?

I think you're right, it's dm-crypt that's broken here, with
ultimately the crypto driver causing this corruption. XFS being the
edge to the end-user is taking the brunt of it. There's reports going
back to late 2017 of significant issues with this mainlined stable
driver.

Any guidance would be appreciated.
Kyle.
