I know all that. This was a remark intended at pointing out that this
commit message statement does not have any value, it does not help in
understanding any peculiarity of this target driver (if any). It seems
targeted at zone append only. Reword this to explain the remapping for all
IOs, and that zone management request and report zones also need remapping.

But DM revalidate will be called for the target AFTER it is setup (after
its gendisk is added). So how can DM revalidate see the incorrect zone
size ? If that is the case, then the target constructor is broken or
missing something. DM revalidate zone is generic and only allocates the
zone bitmaps for the target device. There should be not need at all to
touch that function.

Why disallow it ? It will work. Either way is OK but I wanted to point out
that both path are I think equally valid.

Your target information fields are also badly named and make things hard
to understand.

Please test properly. This should have been caught in testing before sending.
