'IRQ' means 'hipri=0' of fio configuration.

The above performance test was performed on one x86 machine with one
single nvme disk. I did the test on another aarch64 machine with more
nvme disks, showing that this performance drop didn't occure...

Please see my reply in another thread for detailed test results.
