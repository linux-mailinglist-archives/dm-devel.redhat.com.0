I am sorry, but I am not blaming anybody here.
I am just trying to put my observation here and trying to understand
if someone else have seen a similar issue.
Toolchain side also, it seems the same as it comes from Yocto itself.

It seems there is some relation between dm-verity FEC correction and
squashfs decompression.
So I was looking for some clues from both sides.

Anyways, thank you so much for your suggestion.
Yes, we are analysing the Yocto side build difference as well between
Ubuntu 16 and 18.

Thank you!
