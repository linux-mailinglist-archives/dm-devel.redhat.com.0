So unless I'm missing something, we'd only really want this for removing
a kpartx device, in the case where somehow you have /dev/loopXpY
partitions without the LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN flag set on the disk. That
seems like it shouldn't happen in the first place.  Obviously, you
showed that it can with parted.  But I would argue that this is a bug in
parted.  If parted is creating partitions, it should set
LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN so the partition nodes get cleaned up.

I suppose kpartx could check if there are partition devices for the loop
device, and if so, it could set LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN before doing the
remove. But setting it unilaterally would just cause it to create an
extra set of devices that would only serve to confuse people (and lvm).

Also, the actual partition /dev/loopXpY will always get removed. It's
just the devnode that stays around, and that won't confuse lvm. This
isn't that odd for loop devices. The /dev/loopX devnodes will stay
around once you're done with them, regardless of whether you create the
loop device will kpartx or losetup.

So this example shows exactly why I don't want both /dev/loopXpY and
/dev/mapper/loopXpY. Whenever we use your -P option we can run into
this situation, right?

Martin, do you have any feelings on this.
