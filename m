Indeed.  The fake byte addressability is indeed the problem, and the
fix is to not do that, at least on the second attempt.

Well, the answer for other interfaces (at least at the gold plated
cost option) is so strong internal CRCs that user visible bits clobbered
by cosmic rays don't realisticly happen.  But it is a problem with the
cheaper ones, and at least SCSI and NVMe offer the error list through
the Get LBA status command (and I bet ATA too, but I haven't looked into
that).  Oddly enough there has never been much interested from the
fs community for those.

I'm sorry, I have completely missed that it has been added.  And it's
been in for a whole year..
