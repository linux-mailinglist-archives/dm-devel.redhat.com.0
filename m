Again, trying to figure out what subsystem does, and does not, want
stuff like this does not scale either.  Remember, we had 4000 developers
last year, how are you going to tell all of them what the special rules
are for your subsystem and how they differ from any other subsystem?

And why does it matter?  We are all working on the same project, why
wouldn't you want to see core block device handling patches?  What
hurts with that, someone might notice something in one of them that a
different developer did not.

Anyone on a kernel subsystem mailing list should expect to see kernel
patches, that's part of the process, and always has been.

Kernel subsystems are not silos, people on them should be aware of what
else is going on in order to stay informed.  And again, if it's a huge
problem, one click/keystroke and they are gone, no waste.
