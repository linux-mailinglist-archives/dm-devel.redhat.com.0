This is not a -v3 log, right? We can't see much what multipathd is
doing. Anyway, I understand now that verify_paths() won't help. It
looks only for paths that have been removed (i.e. don't exist any more
in sysfs) since the last path detection. But then, when the error
occurs, it seems that sdf has been removed *and re-added*. So, the
check whether the path still exists succeeds. The uevents were also
missed because the uevent handler didn't get the lock.

Yes, this is a very good point, and it's indeed strange. multipathd
should have opened a file descriptor to /dev/sdf in pathinfo(), and as
long as that file is open, the use count shouldn't drop to 0, the disk
devices (block device and scsi_disk device) shouldn't be released, and
the major/minor number shouldn't be reused. Unless I'm missing
something essential, that is.

Less than 0.1s between the disappearance of 4:0:0:2 as sdf and reappearance
of 2:0:0:0, without any sign of multipathd having noticed this change,
is indeed quite strange.

So we can only conclude that (if there's no kernel refcounting bug,
which I doubt) either orphan_path()->uninitialize_path() had been
called (closing the fd),  or that opening the sd device had failed in
the first place (in which case the path WWID should have been nulled in
pathinfo(). In both cases it makes little sense that the path should
still be part of a struct multipath.=20

Please increase the log level of the "Couldn't open device node"
message in pathinfo(), and see if respective errors are logged.

Can you verify in the debugger if multipathd still has the fd to the
disk device open?

Perhaps you could trace scsi_disk_release() in the kernel?

Martin
