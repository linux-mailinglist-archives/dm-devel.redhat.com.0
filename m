I've just spent a few hours trying to figure this out. Unfortunately,
it isn't easy. pp->uid_attribute may be set from the hwtable, which
means that vendor/product must be known, which in turn means that
uid_attribute can't be set correctly before sysfs_pathinfo() is run.

Thus, in order to be consistent, we need to move the filter_property()
quite a bit further down in pathinfo(), after the call to
sysfs_pathinfo(). That can be done, I already have a (basically)
working code here (most of the work was fixing the unit tests).

*However*, that has a side effect. As you said correctly above,=A0
pp->uid_attribute currently is *never* set the first time the call
chain=A0pathinfo()->filter_property() is run. After the proposed change,
it would=A0*always* be set in this call chain, possibly leading to more
cases where pathinfo returns PATHINFO_SKIPPED.

AFAICS this would matter e.g. for "multipath -w". When we remove a
WWID, we must be sure get_refwwid() fills in the wwid, which won't
happen if PATHINFO_SKIPPED is returned. (This would only affect paths
that filter_property() would skip, so it's just a corner case, yet it
might confuse people in certain situations).

In order not to break such use cases, we need to make the
filter_property() test in pathinfo() dependent on DI_BLACKLIST. That
would make a lot of sense, but it'd cause another semantic change.
d51da42 ("libmultipath: move filter_property|devnode() from
path_discover() into pathinfo()") had deliberately not made this
change.

Well, I'll submit a patch set, in order to make you see how this would
end up looking. But I wouldn't propose to queue that up for mainline
just yet. I strongly hope that the fix for add_map_with_path() alone
will fix lixiaokeng's issue.

Cheers,
Martin
