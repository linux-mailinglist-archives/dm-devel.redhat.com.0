I've recently been debugging an issue that isn't this exact issue
(it occurs in 5.10), but looks somewhat similar.
On a host that
- Is running a kernel 5.4 >= x >= 5.10.47 at least
- Using an EXT4 + LUKS partition
- Running Elasticsearch stress tests

We see that the index files used by the Elasticsearch process become
corrupt after some time, and in each case I've seen so far the content
of the file looks like the EXT4 extent header. 
	#define EXT4_EXT_MAGIC          cpu_to_le16(0xf30a)

For example:
$ hexdump -C /hdd1/nodes/0/indices/c6eSGDlCRjaWeIBwdeo9DQ/0/index/_23c.si

I'm working on tracing exactly when this happens, but I'd be interested
to hear if that sounds familar or might have a similar underlying cause
beyond the commit that was reverted above.

Cheers,
