Ah. Didn't think about that.

Yeah. makes sense.

Sure. We do want to wait long enough to be fairly sure that udev isn't
just being a little bit slow.

This would also handle the case where multipathd simply wasn't
tracking the path for some reason. If the device doesn't exist in the
udev database at all, do with send an "add" event instead of a "change"
event?

IIRC, the initial reason why INIT_MISSING_UDEV was added was because
sometimes udev workers timed out, causing them to not run all the rules.
Do you know offhand if USEC_INITIALIZED is set in this case? If we could
differentiate between the following states:

1: udev hasn't gotten an event for a device
2: udev got an event but timed out or failed while processing it
3: udev successfully processed the event for the device, but multipath
   isn't seeing the attributes it was expecting.

We could react more sensibly.
