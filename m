I feel we need the ability to walk the entire graph and call down to
next level.  The lowest level would be what you call a "valid cookie"
that blk-mq returned.  But the preceding cookies need to be made valid
and used when walking the graph (from highest to lowest) and calling
down to the underlying layers.

If you feel that is doable: certainly give it a shot.

But it is not clear to me how you intend to translate from cookie passed
in to ->blk_poll hook (returned from submit_bio) to the saved off
bio->orig.

What is your cookie strategy in this non-recursive implementation?  What
will you be returning?  Where will you be storing it?
