In my view the WWID should never change. If a snapshot is created it
should either obtain a new WWID. An example out of a Hitachi array is

Device Identification VPD page:
Addressed logical unit:
designator type: T10 vendor identification, code set: ASCII
vendor id: HITACHI=20
vendor specific: 50403B050709
designator type: NAA, code set: Binary
0x60060e80123b050050403b0500000709

The majority of the naa wwid is tied to the storage subsystem and
identifies the vendor oui, model, serial etc. The last 4 in this
example indicate the LDEV ID (Sorry mainframe heritage here..). When a
snapshot is taken these 4 will change as a new LDEV ID is assigned to
the snapshot. This sort of behaviour should be consistent across all
storage vendors imho.
