I admit, I didn't find a definitive race. I was just worried about the
possibility of the dmi being outdated. While there's always the
possibility of the multipath device's RO state getting changed outside
of multipathd (by a multipath call for example), this is not the place
to deal with that. ev_add_map() would be. After looking at this, I'm
o.k. with trusting the existing dmi, especially if we are updating it in
ev_add_map().

So the idea would be to never try reloading read-write when the map is
marked as RO, until we get a path event updating the RO state? I do
worry about cases where well fail to reload the map correctly then.
Imagine that we have a map with mpp->ro=3D1 with one read-only path. The
read-only path gets removed. If we just assume that the mpp->ro state is
correct until with get a path_event changing the read-only state, we
will won't reload read/write here.  The other option would be to check
the path's RO state every time we reload, or at least whenever we're
reloading to remove a path. That has the advantage that it doesn't
produce a dm error message like a failed reload does, but I'm not sure
if it's any less work. Or am I misunderstanding what you are suggesting
here?

If sysfs says one of the paths is read-only, it seems reasonable to skip
the read/write reload.
