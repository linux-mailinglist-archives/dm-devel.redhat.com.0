IMO, adding inline encryption support to dm-crypt would be fine.  Normally,
blk-crypto is just an alternate implementation of encryption/decryption.  I'm
not sure that a separate dm target is warranted just because of a different
implementation, as opposed to different *behavior*.  (Support for wrapped keys
does complicate things a bit, as they do change behavior.)  But, I'd also be
fine with a separate dm target if the dm maintainers prefer that route.

Note that in the Android Common Kernels, there is already a dm target called
"dm-default-key" which uses dm-crypt compatible syntax but uses blk-crypto
(inline encryption) rather than the crypto API:
https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/refs/heads/android-mainline/drivers/md/dm-default-key.c

It differs slightly from what is being proposed here in that dm-default-key's
purpose is to implement filesystem "metadata encryption", so it has logic to
skip encrypting blocks that have their encryption controlled at the filesystem
level due to being part of an encrypted file's contents.  I expect that logic
would be unacceptable upstream, as it's a layering violation.  (The long-term
plan is to handle metadata encryption entirely at the filesystem level instead.)

But with that potentially-controversial logic removed, it would basically be
dm-inline-crypt already, so it would be a good starting point.
