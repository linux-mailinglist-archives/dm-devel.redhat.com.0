> The issue is that the implementations of aead and skcipher in the QAT driver are not properly supporting requests with the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag set.

Thanks Giovanni. Joel (from Intel) reached out to me out of band to
try and sell me further on QAT but wasn't able to follow-up on any
questions (like - how is the device actually used, how can I
personally help, etc).

> If the HW queue is full, the driver returns -EBUSY [1] but does not enqueues the request as dm-crypt expects [2]. Dm-crypt ends up waiting indefinitely for a completion to a request that was never submitted, therefore the stall.

Makes sense - this kernel driver has been destroying users for many
years. I'm disappointed that this critical bricking failure isn't
searchable for others.

> This is not related to QATE-7495 'An incorrectly formatted request to QAT can hang the entire QAT endpoint' [3], which occurs when a malformed request is sent to the device.

That's nice to hear that the device itself isn't dying, but it's been
completely destroying systems for years which itself is a DoS.

> I'm working at patch that resolves this problem. In the meanwhile a workaround is to blacklist the qat_c3xxx.ko driver.

I'm not writing this facetiously, but this driver has caused
incredible harm over the past 5+ years and seems to continue to do so.
As there's no patch proposed yet, I'm looking for the driver to be
completely removed from the tree as it's presently a pure marketing
campaign that's caused significant harm. If the marketing benefits
(like accelerated crypto + hashing) aren't there when the accelerated
instruction set was pulled from these integrated chips - the driver
continues to serve no purpose for consumers beyond damage. Disabling
the core I/O bits in December 2020 to make this barely work continues
to promote this as a side project as it was never resolved in the
driver.

If I can test patches, or assist with the removal of this present
in-tree malware I'm happy to help.

Kyle.
