clone inherits the original bio's op. I meant to store the
real bio from FS as ->orig_bio always in alloc_io(), and simply trim it in case
of split & re-submission, meantime store orig_bio's ->bi_sector & ->size into
'dm_io' for account purpose. But it looks a bit complicated and messy.

Wrt. dm zone, I'd suggest to double check anywhere orig bio is used,
since only part of orig bio may be mapped in case of splitting, which is
actually post-split.

If bio split won't happen for dm-zone, your patch is fine. But I guess
it isn't true for dm-zone.

Not yet, the fix+cleanup patch actually breaks recent dm io polling, and I
don't figure out one solution yet.
