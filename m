OverlayBD is a generic solution for overlayable and random accessable 
read-only block device, it is a part of container image solution, but 
not only designed for container images. Actually our team also use it in 
VM and other data images.

Container images in format of OverlayBD is not only used in Alibaba, as 
a open-source solution of containerd, it has already have users in 
community. The project also have contributors from community.

I do like erofs, and also looking forward to widely used container image 
solutions via filesystem. But any filesystem container image soultion 
has no conflict with a generic block device image.

All filesystems that access data via block-devices are possible to 
create OverlayBD image, including those widely used filesystems. With 
dm-snapshot or dm-thin providing writable layer for a read-only block 
device, block images can be mounted as full featured filesystem, with 
100% compatibility to those filesystems on normal block devices.

By my tests, erofs, btrfs, squashfs, and other filesystems on OverlayBD 
performs very well, in some certain circumstances, even better that 
those on raw block devices.

Considering sharing page cache, lots of filesystem supports DAX for PMEM 
devices, that might be a way to work around I think. Currently those 
related implementation is not a part of this module.

Thanks for the replying.

Du Rui
