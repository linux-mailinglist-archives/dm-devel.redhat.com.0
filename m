No, we don't. The ABI change is solely reflected in the library
package's symbol versions and abstract provides like the one I showed
above. The SONAME remains formally remains "libmpathpersist.so.0".

They aren't co-installable. But the dependencies make sure that
qemu, multipathd, and possibly other consumers will use the ABI version
that libmpathpersist actually exports. On openSUSE Tumbleweed, our
rebuild policy will ensure this. On the more long-lived products, we
usually can't update the ABI in a backward-incompatible way; our QA
tools would notice if we mistakenly tried. Severe security issues might
justify an exception, in which case we'd provide patches to update the
depending packages in a batch.

openSUSE supports that, too. In the case at hand, you would need to
update the "libmpath0", "multipath-tools", and "qemu-tools" packages
simultaneously.=A0(If you'd try to update just one, the resolver would
tell you that the other two need to be updated as well).

Well, in this case the set of reverse-dependencies is rather small.

In theory, we could. I guess we could also use some heuristics to
transform the LIBMPATHPERSIST... string to a SONAME, making the
libraries co-installable. But so far we didn't need to, and tbh,
given the small number of users of our library, it doesn't seem to make
much sense. Feel free to send patches if you want.

One reason for the symbol versioning rather than SONAME is that it
makes the ABI changes more transparent to ourselves. Using abigail
to compare the latest code against the ABI of the stable version,=20
we can figure out which parts of the ABI actually changed, and reflect
this in our libmpathpersist.version file.

Thus even if we were to support SONAME, I believe we'd continue using
the symbol versioning.

> I asked around a bit and got "this seems very unusual" as feedback.

I'm sorry to hear that. But I see nothing in the docs that mandates
either providing multiple ABI versions, or modifying the SONAME just
because symbol versions are being used.

Martin
