Can you provide the full stack traces for these errors so we can see
exactly what this cascading failure looks like, please? In reality,
the stall messages some time after this are not interesting - it's
the first errors that cause the stall that need to be investigated.

A good idea would be to provide the full storage stack decription
and hardware in use, as per:

https://xfs.org/index.php/XFS_FAQ#Q:_What_information_should_I_include_when_reporting_a_problem.3F

This really sounds like broken hardware, not a kernel problem.

[snip stalled kcryptd worker threads]

This implies a dmcrypt level problem - XFS can't make progress is
dmcrypt is not completing IOs.

Where are the XFS corruption reports that the subject implies is
occurring?

Cheers,

Dave.
