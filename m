Yes, initially that was a significant reason.

More recently, when we've tried switching, the performance loss made it
appear not worth the change. Especially since we also needed to ship a
usable version at the same time.

By "work item strategy" are you referring to the lower level handling of
queueing and executing the work items? Because I've done that. Well, the
first 90%, by making the VDO work queues function as a shim on top of
the kernel ones instead of creating their own threads. It would also
need the kernel workqueues modified to support the SYSFS and ORDERED
options together, because on NUMA systems the VDO performance really
tanks without tweaking CPU affinity, and one or two other small
additions. If we were to actually commit to that version there might be
additional work like tweaking some data structures and eliding some shim
functions if appropriate, but given the performance loss, we decided to
stop there.

Or do you mean the use of executing all actions affecting a data
structure in a single thread/queue via message passing to serialize
access to data structures instead of having a thread serially lock,
modify, and unlock the various different data structures on behalf of a
single I/O request, while another thread does the same for another I/O
request? The model we use can certainly make things more difficult to
follow. It reads like continuation-passing style code, not the
straight-line code many of us are more accustomed to.

"Converting to using Linux workqueues" really doesn't say the latter to
me, it says the former. But I thought I'd already mentioned I'd tried
the former out. (Perhaps not very clearly?)

If we're talking about the lower level handling, I don't think it would
be terribly hard.

I think so, once we're clear on exactly what we're talking about...
