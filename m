Since this is an interesting topic to me. As a holiday project, I started
my new kernel module.

There was a similar project named ABUSE, back in 2009. Unfortunately, it
was rejected.
https://lwn.net/Articles/343514/

The kernel module=E2=80=99s mechanism is very simple:
1. When client code sends a request to /dev/abuseX it is pushed to the
internal queue.
2. When some requests are queued, the userland storage engine is woken up
(usually it waits by epoll or some variant) it pulls one request from the
queue via ioctl (ABUSE_GET_REQ).
3. After processing, it pushes back a completion via ioctl (ABUSE_PUT_REQ).

The original code is bio-based but naota modified it to request-based in
2015.
https://github.com/naota/abuse-kmod

This is my starting point.

The problem I see is, the 2015 version copies bvec pages across the
user-kernel space boundary. I think this is no good because we need to copy
2x the amount of the IO buffers.

The solution I am trying to do is mmap the bvec pages in kernel-space from
the userland. Instead of copying the bvec pages, the kernel passes only the
physical page address to the userland and then the userland engine mmap the
page to some address space in user space. I know mmap has some overhead
because it is system call but the rationale behind this is =E2=80=9Cmmap is=
 better
than copy=E2=80=9D. Since it is not able to access kernel address space dir=
ectly
from the userland, unlike Vitaly above mentions zero-copy I believe some
trick like mmaping is inevitable. Yes, if there is some non-overhead way to
access bvec pages from userland, I want to know that.

Here is the kernel code. Userland-side is written in Rust. It=E2=80=99s alr=
eady
passed a test by badblocks.

&gt;&gt; interest<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; people<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; have in dm-user: when I bring this up I seem to run i=
nto people who&#39;ve<br>
&gt;&gt; done<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; similar things before and are vaguely interested, but=
 certainly nobody<br>
&gt;&gt; is<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; chomping at the bit.=C2=A0 I&#39;m sending it out in =
this early state to try and<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; figure<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; out if it&#39;s interesting enough to keep going.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cc-ing Josef and Mike since their nbd contributions make =
me wonder<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; whether this new driver could be useful to their use case=
s?<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Sorry gmail+imap sucks and I can&#39;t get my email client to=
 get at the<br>
&gt;&gt; original<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; thread.=C2=A0 However here is my take.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; and I guess I then have to apoligize for missing your email ;).=C2=
=A0 Hopefully<br>
&gt;&gt; that<br>
&gt;&gt; was the problem, but who knows.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) The advantages of using dm-user of NBD that you listed are=
n&#39;t actually<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; problems for NBD.=C2=A0 We have NBD working in production whe=
re you can hand<br>
&gt;&gt; off the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; sockets for the server without ending in timeouts, it was act=
ually the<br>
&gt;&gt; main<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; reason we wrote our own server so we could use the FD transfe=
r stuff to<br>
&gt;&gt; restart<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; the server without impacting any clients that had the device =
in use.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; OK.=C2=A0 So you just send the FD around using one of the standard=
 mechanisms to<br>
&gt;&gt; orchestrate the handoff?=C2=A0 I guess that might work for our use=
 case,<br>
&gt;&gt; assuming<br>
&gt;&gt; whatever the security side of things was doing was OK with the old=
 FD.<br>
&gt;&gt; TBH I&#39;m<br>
&gt;&gt; not sure how all that works and while we thought about doing that =
sort of<br>
&gt;&gt; transfer scheme we decided to just open it again -- not sure how f=
ar we<br>
&gt;&gt; were<br>
&gt;&gt; down the dm-user rabbit hole at that point, though, as this sort o=
f arose<br>
&gt;&gt; out<br>
&gt;&gt; of some other ideas.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) The extra copy is a big deal, in fact we already have too =
many copies<br>
&gt;&gt; in our<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; existing NBD setup and are actively looking for ways to avoid=
 those.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t take this as I don&#39;t think dm-user is a good id=
ea, but I think at<br>
&gt;&gt; the very<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; least it should start with the very best we have to offer, st=
arting with<br>
&gt;&gt; as few<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; copies as possible.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I was really experting someone to say that.=C2=A0 It does seem kin=
d of silly to<br>
&gt;&gt; build<br>
&gt;&gt; out the new interface, but not go all the way to a ring buffer.=C2=
=A0 We just<br>
&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t<br>
&gt;&gt; really have any way to justify the extra complexity as our use cas=
es aren&#39;t<br>
&gt;&gt; that high performance.=C2=A0 =C2=A0I kind of like to have benchmar=
ks for this sort of<br>
&gt;&gt; thing, though, and I didn&#39;t have anyone who had bothered avoid=
ing the last<br>
&gt;&gt; copy<br>
&gt;&gt; to compare against.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; If you are using it currently in production then cool, there&=
#39;s clearly a<br>
&gt;&gt; usecase<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; for it.=C2=A0 Personally as I get older and grouchier I want =
less things in<br>
&gt;&gt; the<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; kernel, so if this enables us to eventually do everything NBD=
 related in<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; userspace with no performance drop then I&#39;d be down.=C2=
=A0 I don&#39;t think you<br>
&gt;&gt; need to<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; make that your primary goal, but at least polishing this up s=
o it could<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; potentially be abused in the future would make it more compel=
ling for<br>
&gt;&gt; merging.<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; Ya, it&#39;s in Android already and we&#39;ll be shipping it as pa=
rt of the new OTA<br>
&gt;&gt; flow for the next release.=C2=A0 The rules on deprecation are a bi=
t different<br>
&gt;&gt; over<br>
&gt;&gt; there, though, so it&#39;s not like we&#39;re wed to it.=C2=A0 The=
 whole point of<br>
&gt;&gt; bringing<br>
&gt;&gt; this up here was to try and get something usable by everyone, and =
while I&#39;d<br>
&gt;&gt; eventually like to get whatever&#39;s in Android into the kernel p=
roper we&#39;d<br>
&gt;&gt; really<br>
&gt;&gt; planned on supporting an extra Android-only ABI for a cycle at lea=
st.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m kind of inclined to take a crack at the extra copy, to at =
least see if<br>
&gt;&gt; building something that eliminates it is viable.=C2=A0 I&#39;m not=
 really sure if<br>
&gt;&gt; it is<br>
&gt;&gt; (or at least, if it&#39;ll net us a meaningful amount of performan=
ce), but<br>
&gt;&gt; it&#39;d at<br>
&gt;&gt; least be interesting to try.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; It&#39;d be nice to have some benchmark target, though, as otherwi=
se this stuff<br>
&gt;&gt; hangs on forever.=C2=A0 My workloads are in selftests later on in =
the patch<br>
&gt;&gt; set, but<br>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m essentially using tmpfs as a baseline to compare against e=
xt4+dm-user<br>
&gt;&gt; with<br>
&gt;&gt; some FIO examples as workloads.=C2=A0 Our early benchmark numbers =
indicated<br>
&gt;&gt; this was<br>
&gt;&gt; way faster than we needed, so I didn&#39;t even bother putting tog=
ether a<br>
&gt;&gt; proper<br>
&gt;&gt; system to run on so I don&#39;t really have any meaningful numbers=
 there.=C2=A0 Is<br>
&gt;&gt; there<br>
&gt;&gt; an NBD server that&#39;s fast that I should be comparing against?<=
br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; I haven&#39;t gotten a whole lot of feedback, so I&#39;m inclined =
to at least have<br>
&gt;&gt; some<br>
&gt;&gt; reasonable performance numbers before bothering with a v2.<br>
