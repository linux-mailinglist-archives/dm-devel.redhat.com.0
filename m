Problem is that we need to look at the BIO op in submission AND completion
path to handle zone append requests. So looking at the clone on submission
is OK since its op is still the original one. But on the completion path,
the clone may now be a regular write emulating a zone append op. And
looking at the clone only does not allow detecting that zone append.

We could have the orig_bio op saved in dm_io to avoid completely looking
at the orig_bio for detecting zone append.
