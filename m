Right. I added the __post_config_state() there in order to be sure that
child() would be woken up. But unblock_reconfigure() should only call
__post_config_state if running_state is DAEMON_IDLE, like
schedule_reconfigure(). Otherwise, it can be sure that some other
process will wake up child().

Agreed. My thinking was that this is done by the uevent handler when
the state of need_to_delay_reconfig() changes. But you're right with
the "remove" special case. We should re-add this, it definitely doesn't
hurt.

So we should call unblock_reconfigure() from remove_map().
Unfortunately that requires another callback from libmultipath into
multipathd. Trying to figure it out...=20
