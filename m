Thanks for cleaning up the text to make the discussion easier! Sorry I
only mentioned it [3] in the cover letter and didn't provide one in
previous reply. [3] was done in a quick-and-dirty way (I plan to send a
formal merge request after finishing the kernel part) and there is no need
to read it. Let's me explain what [3] does here instead,
  1) After unlocking the LUKS-encrypted device, if cryptsetup finds
     /sys/kernel/crash_luks_volume_key exists, it will write the key
     description of the volume key to it to notify the kernel to save a copy
     of this logon key linked to its thread keyring for the kdump kernel
  2) After the 1st kernel crashes, if crytpsetup finds it's in the kdump
     kernel, instead of deriving the volume key from a passphrase, it
     will write the key description to /sys/kernel/crash_luks_volume_key
     to ask the kdump kernel to link the saved key to its thread keyring.

Thanks for pointing me to the above MR which looks promising! Unlike
treating the kdump use case as a special case [3], it just provides a
generic way with the implemented options --link-vk-to-keyring and
--volume-key-keyring.

Actually I should thank you for your patience! You have been always
offering your feedback on this work kindly and promptly starting with
the first proposed solution [1].

Sure, I'll talk to them first. Thanks for letting Ondra know!
