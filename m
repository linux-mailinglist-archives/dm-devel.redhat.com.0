So, the crux of my idea is that we disallow setting the alias_prefix to
conflicting values like this in the config. After we parse the
configuration, we have to go through all the alias_prefix settings and
sanitize them.  If there's a alias_prefix in the overrides section,
there's nothing to do, since all devices will use the same prefix.
Otherwise, we need to make sure that no prefixes in the devices section
are either starting substrings or starting superstrings of the default
alias prefix. Additionally, we need to make sure that no devices section
alias prefixes are starting substrings of another devices section alias
prefix. If there is an invalid devices section alias_prefix, we need to
print an error message and ignore it.

For instance, say that the default prefix is "mpath". If there was a
devices section prefix that was "mp" or "mpathdev", we would print a
error and simply ignore that setting, since "mp" is a starting
substring of the default prefix, and "mpathdev" is a staring superstring
of the default prefix. Devices of that type would just use the default
"mpath" prefix.  Similarly, if there were two separate device section
configs that had alias prefixes of "emc" and "emcdev", we would ignore
the "emc" prefix, since it is a staring substring of "emcdev" (or we
could choose to ignore the superstring prefixes for conflicts between
two device section configs, it doesn't really matter which one we
ignore).

I realize that this is a new limitiation we are adding to multipath.
Users were previously able to have device specific alias prefixes of
"mp", for instance. But I would argue that we don't need to support
conflicting prefixes.  Obviously, distrubutions may want to avoid adding
this change until they are able to safely make non-backwards compatible
changs. But I have pretty strong doubts that this change would
negatively effect anyone.=20

After parsing the config file, we will have a list of valid prefixes
that do not conflict. Thus if strncmp(bdg->alias, prefix,
strlen(prefix)) matches for one of the prefixes, it will not match for
any other. Armed with this list of valid prefixes, when we add bindings
to our list, we are able to sort them in alias order.  Now, when we read
the the bindings from the bindings file, it's possible that some of them
will not match any of our valid prefixes, but that's fine. If an alias
doesn't match a valid prefix, we won't sort it in alias order, because
we can't.  But since we only give out aliases that use the valid
prefixes, we will never need to search through those non-matching
aliases to find a free one. So we don't care how they are ordered, just
so long as they don't come in the middle of a valid prefix group.

To add a new binding, we first figure out if its alias matches a valid
prefix. If it doesn't, we simply scan backwards through our existing
list of bindings till we find an alias that comes alphabetically before
it, and add the binding after that. If it does match a valid prefix, we
scan backwards looking for the first alias that matches the prefix or is
before it alphabetically. If we find a binding whose alias comes before
it, then there are no devices with this prefix, and we add the new
binding after it. If we find a binding with an alias whose start matches
this prefix, we found our prefix group. Then we start searching
backwards by ID until we either find a binding with an ID smaller than
ours or we find a binding whose alias doesn't match our prefix, and we
add the binding after it.

Yep. I'm fine with going ahead with this patchset as it is. Both sorting
the bindings in alias order and updating the bindings if
/etc/multipath/bindings has changed are things that can get looked at
afterwards. And I'm fine with doing this work, if you want.
