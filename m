Is there any link which holds the discussion?

But dm kcopy has supported bdev copy already, so once your patch is
ready, dm kcopy can just sends one bio with REQ_COPY if the device
supports offload command, otherwise the current dm kcopy code can work
as before.

What is the fabrics kernel user? Any kernel target code(such as nvme target)
has file/bdev path available, vfs_copy_file_range() should be fine.

Also IMO, kernel copy user shouldn't be important long term, especially if
io_uring copy_file_range() can be supported, forwarding to userspace not
only gets better performance, but also cleanup kernel related copy code
much.
