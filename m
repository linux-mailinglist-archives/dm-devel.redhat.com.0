With OTA, it is challenging to have one general COW format - for instance
what is good for the Android ecosystem may not be useful for the
enterprise world.
For ex: Most of the space savings in Android comes from COPY operation i.e
for an incremental OTA, we would have metadata which states:

COPY BLOCK X -> BLOCK Y

There is no compression involved with these operations. Compression is only
when a block is "replaced". All these are too specific to the Android ecosystem.

I don't want to hijack this conversation here as the current patch is more
specific; however, since you mentioned about the standardization of OTA updates,
I want to bring up the aspect of block device in user space which gives you the
flexibility for users to define COW format as required. There are already couple
of use cases which we are aware off (one being android OTA) and there are
few open source work such as [1] .
