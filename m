I agree with Mike, but I also want to note the following.

dm-clone commits its on-disk metadata periodically every second, and
every time a FLUSH or FUA bio is written. This is done to improve
performance.

This means the dm-clone device behaves like a physical disk that has a
volatile write cache. If power is lost you may lose some recent writes,
_and_ dm-clone might need to rehydrate some regions.

So, you can't discard a region on the source device after the copy
operation has finished, because then the following scenario will result
in data corruption:

1. dm-clone hydrates a region
2. dm-clone discards the region on the source device, either
    synchronously (a) or asynchronously (b)
3. The system crashes before the metadata is committed
4. The system comes up, and dm-clone rehydrates the region, because it
    thinks it has not been hydrated yet
5. The source device might contain garbage for this region, since we
    discarded it previously
6. You have data corruption

So, you can only discard hydrated regions for which the metadata have
been committed on disk.

I think you could discard hydrated regions on the source device
periodically, right after committing the metadata.

dm-clone keeps track of the regions hydrated during each metadata
transaction, so after committing the metadata for the current
transaction, you could also sent an asynchronous discard for these
regions.
