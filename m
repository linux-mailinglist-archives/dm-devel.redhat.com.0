Yes.

You could store a pointer (to orig bio, or per-bio-data stored in split
clone, or whatever makes sense for how you're associating poll data with
split bios) in 'unsigned int' type but that's very clumsy -- as I
discovered when trying to do that ;)

Union looks ideal, but maybe make it a void *?  Initial implementation
may store bio pointer but it _could_ evolve to be 'struct blk_poll_data
*' or whatever.  But not a big deal either way.

I thought I said as much before but: I really don't have anything
meaningful to share.  My early exploration was more rough pseudo code
that served to try to get my arms around the scope of the design
problem.

Please feel free to own all aspects of this work.

I will gladly help analyze/test/refine your approach once you reach the
point of sharing RFC patches.

Thanks,
Mike
