"umount /opt" doesn't hang. It waits one second (until dmsetup resume is 
called) and then proceeds.

Then, it fails with "rmmod: ERROR: Module brd is in use" because the 
script didn't unmount /mnt/test.

But lvm may freeze filesystems anytime - so we'd get randomly returned 
errors then.

The kernel currently distinguishes between kernel-initiated freeze (that 
is used by the XFS scrub) and userspace-initiated freeze (that is used by 
the FIFREEZE ioctl and by device-mapper initiated freeze through 
freeze_bdev).

Perhaps we could distinguish between FIFREEZE-initiated freezes and 
device-mapper initiated freezes as well. And we could change the logic to 
return -EBUSY if the freeze was initiated by FIFREEZE and to wait for 
unfreeze if it was initiated by the device-mapper.
