OK, then why you cannot store it to the (2nd) kdump kernel keyring?
(From the kdump area copy, then you do not need to patch anything else
in dm-crypt than that one line storing the key to the kdump area.)

A clear approach would be to store the key in the 2nd kernel kdump keyring
and allow userspace to read it.
Then cryptsetup can just validate the key (LUKS key digest does not use Argon)
and activates it without asking for a passphrase.
Perhaps this will need some new cryptsetup option (or API call), but I think
it can be done.

Or, you can actually simulate it with
   cryptsetup open ... --master-key-file <file>
where this keyfile contains directly the volume key, not a passphrase.
The key digest is verified in this case only; no costly PBKDF is needed.

If you have a way to retrieve the kdump stored key to kdump userspace, this
is perhaps a much simpler solution.

All this is against all countermeasures to not expose encryption key
directly - but if kdump is debugging environment, just saying...
