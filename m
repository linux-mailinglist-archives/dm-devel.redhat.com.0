That ... would require a fair amount of userspace changes, though at
least e2fsprogs has pluggable io drivers, which would make mmapping a
character device not too awful.

xfsprogs would be another story -- porting the buffer cache mignt not be
too bad, but mkfs and repair seem to issue pread/pwrite calls directly.
Note that xfsprogs explicitly screens out chardevs.
