DM's core and target versions aren't intended to be in service of
error reporting. You abusing them like that is a fundamental problem.

[[Unfortunate tangent but you've left me no choice:

Your general tone and misinformation-using-broad-strokes makes me both
sad and angry. I will restrain myself in this reply but your position
drips with general FUD and loathing. This is way more "Milan being

it all just gushed out, no idea. But it's a lot to try to take with
grace.

As you know I'm a very direct person. I speak my mind too. But I've
learned to try to avoid alarmist rhetoric that amounts to throwing
people(s) under the bus (better late than never). But if you're going
to resort that you better be _very_ certain it's justified. Yet as
cathartic as it might seem, even then it isn't the correct answer. If
you want to remain being respected please treat others with respect.

Only you know why you are flailing about with such an attitude, please
come to terms with that. I wish you well and certainly don't want DM
to be some constant or reoccurring source of such negativity (for you
or anyone).]]

(I saw your "below", it lacked a coherent explanation for why "we need
to use both" as a rule moving forward)

When done properly it will _not_ require both. The version number would
be incremented one final time and would serve to allow existing
userspace to run unmodified. But from that point on the bitmap flags
should be used and all userspace converted to use them.

You know how to send email to report specific problems and/or submit
patches. But I really don't recall anything in this category being
reported by you, certainly not recently... maybe you've just
internalized or I somehow missed it?

dm-verity's optional "try_verify_in_tasklet" is using tasklets as an
implementation detail, if they cannot be used (e.g. for FEC) then why
would fallback to normal verification using a workqueue be reported?

Or are you referring to something you saw when using dm-crypt's
no_{read,write}_workqueue options?

Or are you saying that both the new dm-verity try_verify_in_tasklet
option and the dm-crypt no_{read,write}_workqueue options should
fallback to removing those flags and try without them?

That is a level of AI I have no interest in adding or supporting.
The user asked for something, if it isn't possible then it should
fail.

But please be more specific.

"Please extend the DM ioctls to somehow add ti->error to the userspace
response" is a fine feature request. Should help no matter what.

(Can look to have a phased approach to the error reporting payload,
start with errno and error message, add more "structured" payload over
time. Are you referring to JSON or some other format? Whatever systemd
uses?).

All errors should be emitted with pr_err() using DMERR(). I've made a
conscious effort to convert DMWARN() to DMERR() when appropriate. But
I'll audit all the DM core code and then work through the various
targets.

If there are incorrect log levels being used it is a bug, please
report and/or fix.

Again, if you see a bug: please report and/or fix it.

There is no way to properly use version numbers to derive what
actually went wrong. Could you narrow down and isolate the possible
failure based on version in specific cases? Sure.. but it is insanely
fragile (especially with stable@ and distro kernels).

OK, I can just avoid switching to feature bitmaps entirely, stop
bumping version numbers, and focus on better error reporting. Then all
of userspace can rely on errors reported to fail and inform user
actions.

But I'm pretty confident lvm2 will have something to say on
this... I'll take all input into consideration.
