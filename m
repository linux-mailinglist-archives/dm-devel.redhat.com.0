Hi, Stefan,

sorry for the late reply. I missed your message since I don't use that email address anymore.
Sent a patch to fix the stale address in .mailmap.

The main idea is to reach the best performance and density. This is possible only,
if driver's hot path is implemented in kernel. Comparing to NBD the driver shows
much better results in these criteria.

This has a continuation, and I mean DAX here. IO handling with any userspace-based
implementation will be slower, than DAX in case of kernel-based implementation. So,
in my driver IO handling is done in kernel, while DAX support is a subject of
the future development.

And this driver and advantages of QEMU block layer are not mutually exclusive.
This driver *does not implement* snapshot or backup support, here is only hot-path
doing IO handling.

The use case is containers, and they are the requestor for high density.
The userspace-based implementation overhead will be noticeable on nodes
running a lot of containers (just because of any overhead is noticeable
there :)). Also, it's very useful to use the same disk image for VMs and
containers giving people to choose what they want in the moment.

Best wishes,
Kirill
