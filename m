DM or MD may submit split bio to underlying queue directly, so we can't
do that simply. Also some FS may call bio_split() too.

Or we simply let blk_throtl_bio cover everything? That is basically
what V1 did, and the only issue is that we can't run the account
in case that submit_bio_noacct() is called from blk_throtl_dispatch_work_fn().

It doesn't matter, blk_throtl_charge_bio_split() just accounts bio
number, here the split bio is submitted to the same queue.

It is fragile, will the bio allocated from bio_split() always
submitted finally? or submitted to same queue?

I don't think it is hacks, it is one approach which has been verified as
workable in blk-mq.

Here the issue is just about bio number accounting.

BTW, maybe you can follow blk-mq's way: just account after io is split,
such as, move start_io_acct() to the end of __split_and_process_non_flush(),
then you can just account io start once.
