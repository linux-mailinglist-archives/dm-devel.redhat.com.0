I appreciate you taking the initiative on this; polling support is on my
TODO so your work serves as a nice reminder to pursue this more
urgently.

I'd have to look closer at the race in the code you wrote (though you
didn't share it); but we cannot avoid properly mapping a cookie to each
split bio.  Otherwise you resort to inefficiently polling everything.

Seems your attempt to have the cookie point to a dm_io object was likely
too coarse-grained (when bios are split they get their own dm_io on
recursive re-entry to DM core from ->submit_bio); but isn't having a
list of cookies still too imprecise for polling purposes?  You could
easily have a list that translates to many blk-mq queues.  Possibly
better than your current approach of polling everything -- but not
much.

You showed 40% performance improvement but it really just does the bare
minimum of implementing polling.  It is so simplistic that I really
don't think the design even serves as a starting point for what will be
needed.  So this needs further design time.

What you've _done_ could serve as a stop-gap but I'd really rather we
get it properly designed from the start.

I'll look closer at all this.  But DM targets do allow for additional
target specific per-bio-data to be added to the overall per-bio-data
size (via ti->per_io_data_size).  DM core _could_ internalize adding
additional space to per-bio-data for storing a unique cookie per
split/clone bio.

Conversely, block-core's bio cloning could manage this so long as it
knew how to access the offset into the established per-bio-data.  But
that might be more challenging to do without impacting use-cases outside
of DM.

Thanks,
Mike
