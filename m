I did one on network fs security at a security summit before that would
still be relevant to both

I&#39;ve got one:=C2=A0 Cryptographic material handling.<br>
<br>
Subtitle could be: making keyrings more usable.<br>
<br>
The broad problem is that the use of encryption within the kernel is<br>
growing (from the old dm-crypt to the newer fscrypt and beyond) yet<br>
pretty much all of our cryptographic key material handling violates the<br>
principle of least privilege.=C2=A0 The latest one (which I happened to<br>

<br>
specific violation is that key unwrapping should occur as close as<br>
possible to use: when the kernel uses a key, it should be the kernel<br>
unwrapping it not unwrapping in user space and handing the unwrapped<br>
key down to the kernel because that gives a way.=C2=A0 We got here because<=
br>
in most of the old uses, the key is derived from a passphrase and the<br>
kernel can&#39;t prompt the user, so pieces of user space have to gather<br=
>
the precursor cryptographic material anyway.=C2=A0 However, we&#39;re movin=
g<br>
towards using cryptographic devices (like the TPM, key fobs and the<br>
like) to store keys we really should be passing the wrapped key into<br>
the kernel and letting it do the unwrap to preserve least privilege. <br>
dm-crypt has some support for using kernel based TPM keys (the trusted<br>
key subsystem), but this isn&#39;t propagated into systemd-cryptenroll and<=
br>
pretty much none of the other encryption systems make any attempt to<br>
use keyrings for unwrap handling, even if they use keyrings to store<br>
cryptographic material.<br>
<br>
Part of the reason seems to be that the keyrings subsystem itself is<br>
hard to use as a generic &quot;unwrapper&quot; since the consumer of the ke=
ys has<br>
to know exactly the key type to consume the protected payload.=C2=A0 We<br>
could possibly fix this by adding a payload accessor function so the<br>
keyring consumer could access a payload from any key type and thus<br>
benefit from in-kernel unwrapping, but there are likely a host of other<br>
issues that need to be solved.=C2=A0 So what I&#39;d really like to discuss=
 is:<br>
<br>
Given the security need for a generic in-kernel unwrapper, should we<br>
make keyrings do this and if so, how?<br>
