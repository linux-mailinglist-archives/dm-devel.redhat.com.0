I've seen lot efforts on this, for example,
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lBKVrYzm9JEYuw-gIEsrcePSK0jL1Boe/edit#slide=id.p22

Merging the writable layer and read-only layers with overlayfs is
feasible. I mean, at least for composefs model on backing XFS/btrfs, we
could merge these layers with overlayfs so that I guess reflink could
be done to avoid full copyup as well?  I do think that's a net win.

(e)stargz or zstd:chunked still needs to be converted by the publisher
and not all exist OCI images are stored in this way.  But apart from
detailed comparsion, disk mapping image approaches seems really a
drawback at least on my side.

Anyway, I think it's what OCIv2 would like to eventually address
anyway.

I think composefs model can do both sides. But I'm not sure the final
conclusion, I tend to leave it to the OCI guys.

Yes, what I'd like to say, without finer page cache sharing mechanism,
the composefs way sounds better to me honestly to the whole system.
