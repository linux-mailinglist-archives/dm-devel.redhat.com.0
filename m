Your point of view is very interesting. I like.
I will try to implement it and check how it works.

So far, I see the problem in that the interposer device has to intercept
all bio requests from the original device. It will not be possible to
implement an interception of some part. Device mapper can create its own
target for a part of the block device.

But maybe it's a good thing. First, there is little real benefit from
being able to intercept bio requests from a part of the block device.
In real use, this may not be necessary. Secondly, it will get rid of the
problem when part of the bio needs to be intercepted, and part does not.

I'd like to know Mike's opinion on this issue.

I believe that the BIO_INTERPOSED flag is quite good at solving this
problem. When cloning a bio, the flag is passed, which means that bio
cannot be called twice.


Thank you again.
Because of you, I will have to rewrite some code again ;)
But it's all for the best.
