There are no builtin device configs that set path grouping policy to
FAILOVER. Out of all our builtin configs, the only SCSI one that doesn't
specifically set the path grouping policy is the IBM 3303 NVDISK and I
don't believe that one supports ALUA. I don't know of any vendor who
wants to have a builtin device config for their array, but can't write
an optimal one because they need a different pgpolicy depending on
whether ALUA is or isn't present. So all I was saying is that I don't
think having detect_pgplicy would enable us to add new builtin configs
for arrays that we couldn't handle correctly in all cases before.=20

I do agree that there are likely people who don't bother to edit
multipath.conf for their device, and multipath autodetects alua but
still uses FAILOVER, when it would be better for it to use
GROUP_BY_PRIO. That's why I think your proposal is a good one.
