If something happens on a storage side where a lun gets it's attributes
changed (any, doesn't matter which one) a UA should be sent. Also all
outstanding IO's on that lun should be returning an Abort as it can no
longer warrant the validity of any IO due to these changes. Especially
when parameters are involved like reservations (PR's) etc. If that does
not happen from an array side all bets are off as the only way to be
able to get back in business is to start from scratch.

I think in most cases when something happens on an array side you will
see IO's being aborted. That might be a good time to start doing TUR's
and if these come back OK do a new inquiry. From a host side there is
only so much you can do.
