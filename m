I would expect some issues with FIPS people here (currently, it is handled
by enabling various crypto API drivers) about crypto boundaries and such stuff.
But it is up to the corporate people, not me.

Sadly, nobody did try to push some device-mapper functionality into the block layer.
Then inline encryption can be just a block device configuration or whatever....
(discussed in 2010 or so... https://lwn.net/Articles/400589/)
</sigh>

I would prefer to separate SW FDE (dm-crypt, as it is) and a target that delegates
encryption to the block layer (inline encryption).
But it is just cryptsetup's maintainer view, as we have already too complex
detection which features can be enabled on various kernel configs, etc.

Any plans to submit this to mainline? Or it is just too controversial?

Well, I wish that we have strong authenticated encryption in filesystem even for
metadata, where it fits better in the fist place....
But fscrypt is still not here (or am I mistaken?)
