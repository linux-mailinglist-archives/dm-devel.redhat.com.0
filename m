(Hmm, why did you cc linux-km on this report?  I would have thought
dm-devel would have made more sense?)

So this failure makes no sense to me.  Looking at the kmesg failure
logs, it's failing in the md layer:

kern  :info  : [   99.775514] md/raid1:md0: not clean -- starting background reconstruction
kern  :info  : [   99.783372] md/raid1:md0: active with 3 out of 4 mirrors

user  :notice: [  102.109684] /lkp/benchmarks/mdadm-selftests/tests/01r1fail... FAILED - see /var/tmp/01r1fail.log and /var/tmp/fail01r1fail.log for details

The referenced commit just turns block bitmap prefetching in ext4.
This should not cause md to failure; if so, that's an md bug, not an
ext4 bug.  There should not be anything that the file system is doing
that would cause the kernel to think there is a disk failure.

By the way, the reproduction instructions aren't working currently:

This fails because lkp is trying to apply a patch which does not apply
with the current version of the md tools.

And the current versions lkp don't generate a compatible-job.yaml file
when you run "lkp split-job --compatable"; instead it generates a new
yaml file with a set of random characters to generate a unique name.
(What Multics parlance would be called a "shriek name"[1] :-)

Since I was having trouble running the reproduction; could you send
the /var/tmp/*fail.logs so we could have a bit more insight what is
going on?

Thanks!
