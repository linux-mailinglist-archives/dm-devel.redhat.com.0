Right. Even if blkid was smart enough to check immediately before=20
doing I/O on the device, there would still be a race window.=20

It occured to me that it might be useful if IO on suspended DM devices
failed with -EAGAIN when opened with a non-blocking file descriptor.
But I haven't thought it through ... I suppose that would have other
issues, it would be a breaking change anyway.

The good thing is that most of the time, the devices are suspended only
for a short period of time, so blkid will just hang for a few fractions
of a second. The fact that udev skips calling blkid is only for the
very rare remaining cases in which the suspend state persists for a
long time.

Don't we have that already? Isn't that the check that sets the
DM_SUSPENDED flag?

Part of the consistency problem is that we have a lot of related but
not equivalent udev variables:

DM_SUSPENDED
DM_NOSCAN
DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG
DM_UDEV_DISABLE_SUBSYSTEM_RULES_FLAG
DM_UDEV_DISABLE_DISK_RULES_FLAG

and then of course

SYSTEMD_READY
MPATH_DEVICE_READY

For consumers of these variables (i.e. udev rules from other
subsystems), it's not always obvious which one they should look at
(just my =A40.02).

Martin
