Hi Coiby, thanks for the very interesting work!
I confess I didn't review the code as I have not much experience in
dm-crypt/key management, but I have a generic question related with the
motivation of the patch set.

My understanding is that one (the main?) motivation of this series would
be to protect the saved memory (vmcore) from being read by some
"unauthorized" entity - in order to achieve this goal, it is hereby
proposed to allow kdump kernel to access a memory-saved key and with
that, mount an encrypted volume, saving the vmcore over there correct?

So, what if instead of playing with the volume key, users with this
concern address that by reserving some *unencrypted partition* for
saving the vmcore, but then *encrypt the vmcore* itself! So, instead of
requiring saving a full-volume key, mount everything, risk data
corruption if something goes bad...we just have makedumpfile encrypting
the vmcore with some preloaded key (which might be saved inside the
kdump minimal intird, for example), and saving the encrypted file into a
clear/unencrypted volume? This way we also prevent excessive memory
consumption during kdump due to the lvm/dm-userspace paraphernalia usage.

Does it make sense or am I being silly or missing something?
Cheers,


Guilherme
