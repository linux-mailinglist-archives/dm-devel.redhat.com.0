This is what we currently do.

The error string is not intended to be parsed by userspace (I agree that 
parsing the error string is a horrible idea, but this is not going to 
happen). It is intended to be displayed to the user by tools such as 
cryptsetup or integritysetup. The tool can't read the log, extract 
messages from it and display them.

With "just use errno", the user sees messages like "device-mapper: reload 
ioctl on test (254:0) failed: No such file or directory" and it's not much 
useful because it doesn't tell what went wrong.

Try to type "grep -r 'ti->error = ' drivers/md/|wc -l". There are 480 
distinct error messages generated by device mapper. You can't map each of 
them to a unique errno number.


BTW. we were talking about replacing device mapper version numbers with 
feature bitmaps and people preferred textual lists of features instead of 
bitmaps (because the bitmap will overflow when you have more than 64 
features). Do you oppose to this too? Do you prefer a 64-bit feature 
bitmap or a string with comma-separated list of features?
