What are you guys going on about? ECC memory corrects single-bit
errors in the background, multi-bit errors cause the memory controller
to signal that data is gone. This is how ECC memory has worked since
forever. Typically the kernel's memory-failure path is just throwing
away pages that signal data loss. Throwing away pmem pages is harder
because unlike DRAM the physical address of the page matters to upper
layers.

I am still failing to see the technical argument for why
RWF_RECOVER_DATA significantly impacts the fast path, and why you
think this is somehow specific to pmem. In fact the pmem effort is
doing the responsible thing and trying to plumb this path while other
storage drivers just seem to be pretending that memory errors never
happen.
