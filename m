If not considering process migration, I could somehow avoid iterating
all hw queues, still in the framework of the current implementation. For
example. For example, the CPU number of the IO submitting process could
be stored in the cookie, while the polling routine will only iterate hw
queues to which the stored CPU number maps. Just a temporary insight
though ....
