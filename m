I went through this patchset, have some concerns. Do you mind sending a
formal patchset with some adjustment?

1) maybe put the luks key handling related to crash_dump out into
a separate file. e.g kernel/crash_dump_luks.c. This will reduce the code
complexity to other kdump code from luks handling. At least from code
reading side.
2) please rearrange your patches order so that generic luks handling at
the beginning. Then the x86 specific code comes next. Please refer to
below patchset. Like this, other arch can easily add its specific code
accordingly.

[PATCH v18 0/7] crash: Kernel handling of CPU and memory hot un/plug

And I am wondering
1) in what proportion the luks system is used,
2) in which cases the dumped vmcore have to be saved into luks disk,
   no workaround?
3) with the 1 hour aging of luks key, to what extent it's still
   worthwhile to add the support of luks kdumping? E.g for me, I have
   been using Fedora, and often start kexec-tools service when I need to
   do test kdump w/o reboot. With that, the key has aged.

I am not familiar with LUKS and it's key mechanism, my above concerns
could be shallow, anyone please help clarify if it does impact. Please
also show your support if this adding is really helpful.

Thanks
Baoquan
