I don't have problems with this setup. I haven't really looked into
github actions, and so really don't know how easy it setup rules to run
actions on events other that pushes, pull requests, etc. It seems
reasonable to store those in a seperate repository. It would probably be
good to have Christophe weigh in as well before adding these. Although I
suppose it's always possible to disable these actions in other repos.
