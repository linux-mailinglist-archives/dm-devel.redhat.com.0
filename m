I'd say there are several options and we should aim towards the variant which 
is most usable by normal users.

Making hyper complex  unmount rule logic that basically no user-space tools 
around Gnome/KDE... are able to handle well and getting it to the position 
where only the core kernel developer have all the 'wisdom' to detect and 
decode system state and then 'know what's going on'  isn't the favourite goal 
here.

Freeze should be getting the filesystem into 'consistent' state - filesystem 
should  be able to 'easily' recover and finish all the ongoing  'unfinished' 
process with the next mount without requiring full 'fsck' - otherwise it would 
be useless for i.e. snapshot.

So to me this looks like the win-win strategy where we basically do not loose 
any information  and we also do not leak kernel resources - since i..e in case 
of DM devices - the underlying DM device might have already changed  disk 
characteristics anyway.

If the developers then believe - that 'more variants' of complex behavior are 
necessary - then kernel could have some  sysfs parameter to configure some 
'more advanced' logic  i.e.  keep  'fs mounted'   for those skilled admins who 
are able to go through the deepest corners  here  -  but other then that  
plain 'umount' should really go with the meaning of   a)   manages to umount 
and release a device    b)  in other case reports to a user there is still 
something holding device....

This option was also discussed in the past and it has nasty consequences as
well. Cleanly shutting down a filesystem usually needs to write to the
