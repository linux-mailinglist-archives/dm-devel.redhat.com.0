Why would data recovery after a media error ever be considered a
fast/hot path?  A normal read/write to a fsdax file would not pass the
flag, which skips the poison checking with whatever MCE consequences
that has, right?

pwritev2(..., RWF_RECOVER_DATA) should be infrequent enough that
carefully stepping around dax_direct_access only has to be faster than
restoring from backup, I hope?

Yes, this will help much. :)

(I wonder about improving badblocks to be less sector-oriented and not
have that weird 16-records-max limit, but that can be a later
optimization.)
