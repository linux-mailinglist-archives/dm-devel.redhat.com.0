Hi,
You may also want to consider higher level support for the NVME COMPARE
and SCSI VERIFY(BYTCHK=1) commands. Since PCIe and SAS transports are
full duplex, replacing two READs (plus a memcmp in host memory) with
one READ and one COMPARE may be a win on a bandwidth constrained
system. It is a safe to assume the data-in transfers on a storage transport
exceed (probably by a significant margin) the data-out transfers. An
offloaded COMPARE switches one of those data-in transfers to a data-out
transfer, so it should improve the bandwidth utilization.

I did some brief benchmarking on a NVME SSD's COMPARE command (its optional)
and the results were underwhelming. OTOH using my own dd variants (which
can do compare instead of copy) and a scsi_debug target (i.e. RAM) I have
seen compare times of > 15 GBps while a copy rarely exceeds 9 GBps.


BTW The SCSI VERIFY(BYTCHK=3) command compares one block sent from
the host with a sequence of logical blocks on the media. So, for example,
it would be a quick way of checking that a sequence of blocks contained
zero-ed data.
