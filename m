I meant that when DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG is set, dm-verity
signature becomes mandatory. This new configuration
DM_VERITY_VERIFY_ROOTHASH_SIG_SECONDARY_KEYRING extend this trust to the
secondary trusted keyring, which contains certificates signed (directly
or indirectly) by CA from the builtin trusted keyring.

So yes, this new (optional) configuration *extends* the source of trust
for all dm-verity devices, and yes, it is desirable. I think it should
have been this way from the beginning (as for other authentication
mechanisms) but it wasn't necessary at that time.
