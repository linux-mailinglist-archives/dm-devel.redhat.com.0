So how the heck is someone supposed to know, from userspace, that a
filesystem is unmounted?  Just wearing my SysAdmin hat, this strikes
me as really potentially painful and annoying.  But then again, so are
bind mounts from alot of views too.  

Don't people remember how bad it can be when you are trying to
shutdown and system and it hangs because a remote NFS server is down
and not responding?  And your client system hangs completely?

Can we maybe invert this discussion and think about it from the
userspace side of things?  How does the user(space) mount/unmount
devices cleanly and reliably?

> sudo umount /mnt # shell 1 gets woken

So what makes this *useful* to anyone?  Why doesn't the bind mount
A) lock /mnt into place, but B) give you some way of seeing that
there's a bindmount in place?

Then should it be unmountable in the first place?  I mean yes, we
always need a way to force an unmount no matter what, even if that
breaks some other process on the system, but for regular use,
shouldn't it just give back an error like:

	  /mnt in use by bind mount /opt

or something like that?  Give the poor sysadmin some information on
what's going on here.

ding ding ding!!!!  I don't want to have to run 'lsof' or something
like that.

This is the biggest downside of namespaces and bind mounts in my
mind.  The lack of traceability back to the source.
