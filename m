Yes, try-catch blocks for PMEM is what is needed if it's not there
already from PMDK. Searching for SIGBUS in PMDK finds things like:

No, the big difference with every other modern storage device is
access to byte-addressable storage. Storage devices get to "cheat"
with guaranteed minimum 512-byte accesses. So you can arrange for
writes to always be large enough to scrub the ECC bits along with the
data. For PMEM and byte-granularity DAX accesses the "sector size" is
a cacheline and it needed a new CPU instruction before software could
atomically update data + ECC. Otherwise, with sub-cacheline accesses,
a RMW cycle can't always be avoided. Such a cycle pulls poison from
the device on the read and pushes it back out to the media on the
cacheline writeback.

I don't understand what overprovisioning has to do with better error
management? No other storage device has seen fit to be as transparent
with communicating the error list and offering ways to proactively
scrub it. Dave and Darrick rightly saw this and said "hey, the FS
could do a much better job for the user if it knew about this error
list". So I don't get what this argument about spare blocks has to do
with what XFS wants? I.e. an rmap facility to communicate files that
have been clobbered by cosmic rays and other calamities.

Those exist? Even dm-writecache uses copy_mc_to_kernel().
