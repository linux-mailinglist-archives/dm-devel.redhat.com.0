Thanks, I think it is perfectly fine to implement just subset here.

My comment was just about proper naming in kernel, it is of course up to you
what you want to support in userspace (and even in kernel, extensions can
be added later).

Only LUKS2 uses keyring for volume key in dm-crypt as default option anyway.
I do not think you need any cryptsetup patches, all you need is to write
decrypted volume key from LUKS metadata with
   cryptsetup luksDump ---dump-volume-key -volume-key-file <out> <device>
(or any code equivalent with libcryptsetup), am I correct?
