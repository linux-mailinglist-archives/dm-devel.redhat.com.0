Indeed.

Zone append operations can never be split. That is checked before a user
bio reaches DM __map_bio()/dm_zone_map_bio(). So I think that there is no
issue with the clone+trim change since that will never be done for a zone
append operation.

In the case of emulated zone append, regular writes will still go through
the dm_zone_map_bio() function, and these writes may be split. But then
the orig_bio does not really matter in that case and the zone write
pointer tracking relies on the clone sector & size, not on the original BIO.

I will run more tests with this patch. But so far, this seems all OK.

OK. Let me know if you need help testing.
