The problem I see is with the "delayed reconfigure" approach. We
notify child() about a pending reconfiguration by setting
DAEMON_RECONFIGURE. If clients can request different "types" of
reconfiguration, we would either need an additional flag, or a new
state (e.g. DAEMON_RECONFIGURE_FORCE) to indicate which type of
reconfiguration was requested. And then what to we do if while one
reconfigure is running, the admin runs both "reconfigure force" and
"reconfigure"? We can only schedule only one reconfigure operation. We
should probably assume "force" in that rather unlikely case.

IMO we should not implement _both_ a configuration option
"force_reconfigure" _and_ an additional command "reconfigure force". We
should decide which one we want. If you can come up with a reasonable
logic for the latter, I agree it's better.

Regards,
Martin
