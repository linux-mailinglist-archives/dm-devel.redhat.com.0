Well, nobody has spoken up for 3 months.

Reconsidering the past discussion, I think we shouldn't change this
default. As argued previously, I believe that the majority of multipath
users install some distribution package. Distros either change the
default by patching (like SUSE and Red Hat) or keep the upstream
default. The first class of distros won't change their defaults, so for
them it's just extra work (modifying the downstream patches) without
user benefit. For the second class of distros, changing the upstream
default would cause an unexpected change in behavior for end users.
People who compile the upstream code themselves should have the
knowledge to set the default to suit their needs.

Thoughts? Disagreement?

Martin
