Thanks for all your insights on zoned storage, very appreciated!

OK, good to know.  I do think dm-zoned should be trained to _not_
allow use with ZNS NVMe devices (maybe that is in place and I just
missed it?).  Because there is some confusion with at least one
customer that is asserting dm-zoned is somehow enabling them to use
ZNS NVMe devices!

Maybe they somehow don't _need_ conventional zones (writes are handled
by some other layer? and dm-zoned access is confined to read only)!?
And might they also be using ZNS NVMe devices to do _not_ have a
zone capacity lower than the zone size?

Or maybe they are mistaken and we should ask more specific questions
of them?

You've been extremely helpful, thanks!
