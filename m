Ouch, I'm embarrassed. My own code does not what I described here, it
returns an error if reading the bindings file fails, and does not
replace the current global bindings with an empty list.=A0

We could discuss changing this behavior with a later patch set.

Anyway, I think the basic reasoning was correct: we received an update
event for the file and couldn't prove that our current internal state
was up-to-date; thus we should try to re-read the file next time.
