cryptsetup stores the master key in the thread keyring
(KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING). I couldn't come up with a easy way to store
the key to the (2nd) kdump kernel keyring. For example, one problem is
how can I know in adance the thread ID of cryptsetup? I imagine
drivers/md/dm-crypt.c needs to support a new type of message in
crypt_message so cryptsetup can tell dm-crypt to store the master key
in the thread keyring as a preparation for opening the device. So one
line change of code isn't sufficient. What's more important is I don't see 
any benefit by doing so I regards storing the key to the kdump kernel
keyring first as an unnecessary step.

Thanks for bringing my attention to validating the key! Currently I
simply skip key validation in cryptsetup when implementing the
"--kdump-master-key" option because it requires pass the master key to
the user space. I have a side question, if somehow the master key is
changed and the wrong key is used to get the expanded key, will it lead
to a devastating effect say corrupting the user data on the disk?

I respect and appreciate all the efforts done by you and other community
members to increase security margin so the last thing I want to do is to
reverse the security measures. Besides, I believe some users choose to
dump vmcore to an encrypted disk exactly out of security concern. The
only thing this patch set does about master key is to store it in the
memory exclusively reserved for kdump. To be precise, storing the master
key in the memory exclusively reserved for kdump may be different from
what you mean by "exposing encryption key directly". This reserved memory
won't be used by the 1st kernel (which means if we reserve 1GB more for
the kdump kernel, the 1st kernel would have 1GB less kernel to use. And I
would expect strong objection from the user due to a loss of 1GB memory).
Only kexec knows how to store the master key in this exclusively reserved
memory area and but kexec itself doesn't know to retrieve the master key in
the 1st kernel. So the situation is similar to how expanded key is stored.
struct crypto_aes_ctx has the expanded key, but there is no API to retrieve
it. If you still think this line of reasoning doesn't convince you, how
about encrypting the master key before storing the key to the kdump memory?
kexec could calculate the SHA256 digest of loaded kdump kernel and initrd.
We can use this SHA256 digest to get an encryption key and then encrypt
the master key.
