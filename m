Ok, that answers what I was asking. Thanks. Btw I did not know that
commas could be left out, I found out while I looked into this issue.

So this is about style and readability. Fair enough. It would have been
nice to mention that in the commit message.

The multipath-tools rules do, too; they just don't add whitespace
between the comma and the line continuation marker '\'.

I see. I'll apply this patch then (and the other one with the missing
comma, too), but unless you object, I'll add a note to the
commit message explaining that this for improving readability=20
and coding style compliance. I want to avoid the impression that the
existing code is technically wrong, which it isn't.
