Well, the idea is that there is actually no difference between "weak"
and "hard" reconfigure in terms of the end result. If a change must be
applied to reconcile kernel state and user settings, "weak" reconfigure
will do it. The documentation should express that and avoid stipulating
doubt among users. The main difference is that "hard" reconfigure
always executes a reload operation, which comes down to a
suspend/reload/resume, and thus a) is slow and b) unnecessarily
interrupts IO on the map for a few fractions of a second.

My personal PoV is that we should consider it a bug if a user reports a
situation where a "hard" reconfigure has a different outcome than a
"weak" one. Of course distros need to think twice when any defaults
change, and therefore the way Ben split the patch set makes a lot of
sense. Yet if we had serious doubts that "weak" reconfigure works, we
shouldn't switch to it upstream, either. I personally don't have such
doubts any more. Xose, if I'm missing something, let me know.

Cheers,
Martin
