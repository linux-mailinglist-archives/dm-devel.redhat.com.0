Not necessarily Alibaba, actually OverlayBD solution is open-source to
containerd, at least I think it's an opensource project and I saw some
Microsoft Azure guys are also working on this.

OverlayBD user-space solution was actually the original Alibaba solution
widely used in Alibaba internally, and Nydus might be the another one
(used but limited, Ant group and Bytedance use Nydus more widely.) Since
Alibaba group is a big company, it's pretty normal to have two similiar
competing solutions together.

After I joined Alibaba, personally, I persuaded OverlayBD guys switching
from their stacked storage solution to a simple fs solution, because:

  - It allows a simple on-disk format rather than a long storage stack
    with a random fs, it increases the overall attack vector: which I
    think this year LSF/MM already discuss about that;

  - Different random fses cannot share page cache across images. IOWs,
    many in-kernel fses actually doesn't suit for container image use
    cases;

Also consider this one:
  - Apart from the detailed on-disk design, this attempt is just a
    read-only solution without  1) on-demand load;  2) write support;

  - Very similar to the exist approaches:
    dm-qcow2  https://lore.kernel.org/r/164846619932.251310.3668540533992131988.stgit@pro/
    dm-vdo   https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230523214539.226387-1-corwin@redhat.com/

I also persuaded Nydus guys from their own format to erofs format, but
I failed to persuaded Overlaybd guys.

Agreed.

I'm too tired about these different container image solutions.  I will
go on improve EROFS, and hopefully it will finally useful to everyone.
