I guess the key is that the thread's entry point must also be in
libmultipath (i.e. outside the DSO). In pseudo-code:

entrypoint() {
   refcount++;
   pthread_cleanup_push(refcount--);
   tur_thread(ct);
   pthread_cleanup_pop(1);
}

This way the thread can't be in DSO code any more when refcount goes to
zero.
