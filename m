Mike, that's not justification for making things _more_ dangerous.

Mike, you're the one who's getting seriously hyperbolic here. You're getting
frustrated because you've got this one thing you really want to get done, and
you feel like you're running into a brick wall when I tell you "no".

And yes, coding in the kernel is a complicated, dangerous environment with many
rules that need to be respected.

That does not mean it's ok to be adding to that complexity, and making it even
more dangerous, without a _really fucking good reason_. This doesn't fly. Maybe
it would if it was some device mapper private thing, but you're acting like it's
only going to be used by device mapper when you're trying to add it to the
public interface for core block layer bio code. _That_ needs real justification.

Also, bio_iter is something we should definitely be considering because of the
way integrity and now crypt has been tacked on to struct bio.

When I originally wrote the modern bvec_iter code, the ability to use an
iterator besides the one in struct bio was an important piece of functionality,
one that's still in use (including in device mapper; see
__bio_for_each_segment()). The fact that we're growing additional data
structures that in theory want to be iterated in lockstep with the main bio
payload but _aren't_ iterated over with bi_iter is, at best, a code smell and a
lurking footgun.

However, I can see that the two of you are not likely take on figuring out how
to clean that up, and truthfully I don't have the time right now either, much as
it pains me.

Here's an alternative approach:

The fundamental problem with bio_rewind() (and I know that you two are super
serious that this is completely safe for your use case and no one else is going
to use it for anything else) is that we're using it to get back to some initial
state, but it's not invariant w.r.t. what's been done to the bio since then, and
the nature of the block layer is that that's a problem.

So here's what you do:

You bring back bi_done: bi_done counts bytes advanced, total, since the start
of the bio. Then we introduce a type:

struct bio_pos {
	unsigned	bi_done;
	unsigned	bi_size;
};

And two new functions:

struct bio_pos bio_get_pos(struct bio *)
{
	...
}

void bio_set_pos(struct bio *, struct bio_pos)
{
	...
}

That gets you the same functionality as bio_rewind(), but it'll be much more
broadly useful.
