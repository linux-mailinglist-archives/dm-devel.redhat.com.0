But what do you call a device config that is the result of merging (via
merge_hwe()) a built-in and a non-built-in config.  Do we really want to
track that some of the values of this merged config need to check the
protocol section, and some don't? We could remove merging identical
configs, but that simply makes it harder for users to figure out how
their device will be configured from the configuration output.

I understand your idea. I'd just rather that it worked on all the device
configs, instead of only the built-in ones. I think overriding only the
built-in configs is needlessly complicated, both from a coding and from
an explaining point of view.

That seems reasonable.

Fair enough. I added the overrides section before you made paths have a
vector of device configs. Back then, there was no way to have a device
config that would work like your above example.  My original idea was to
be able to have a special device section like this:

device {
        all_devs yes
=09no_path_retry 75
}

that would get merged with all the device sections. The overrides
section was the compromise after my original idea was NAKed. We probably
could deprecate the overrides section now that we have a vector of
device configs. But then we shouldn't go putting the protocol stuff
there.=20
