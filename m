Thanks for the feedback.
I think you have a point (on documenting hash algo and version in the
IMA record).

For the individual targets (crypt/linear etc.) the target version
is already recorded during table_load [1].
So for new attribute add/update/delete to those targets in future,
they should be accompanied by bumping the relevant target version.
So that the attestation servers would know what attributes to expect,
based on the target's version number.
So individual targets are already taken care of.

But for overall DM records I think some versioning would be useful
to the attestation servers, to determine what to expect for the
attributes that are at device level (i.e. not part of any individual
targets e.g. "minor_count", "num_targets" etc.).

Further, for the DM records that are not "table_load" - what hashing
algo is used to hash active/inactive table is the implementation detail
specific to DM, as Mike called out; and it is orthogonal to IMA's hash
algo.

But I think it would be useful to record the active/inactive table's
hash algo as part of the overall DM record template, so that attestation 
servers would know to how to interpret the relevant data.
(i.e. "active_table_hash", "inactive_table_hash" in [2]).

Both the changes are simple enough.

I will prototype and propose them as incremental patches along with
other changes (pointed to dm-5.15 branch as per Mike's suggestion.)

Thanks for your suggestions again.

Regards,
Tushar
