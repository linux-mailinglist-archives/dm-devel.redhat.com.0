udev rules may not change much, but, for instance, multipathd reacts
differently to add and change events.  So there may be other consumers
of uevents that care about the difference between add and change events.

We simply delete devices that don't exist in sysfs, right? If we get a
non-remove uevent for a device, but it doesn't exist in sysfs, then I
would assume that a remove uevent will be shortly incomming.

Isn't this the most common INIT_PARTIAL case, where we are waiting for
the coldplug uevent? If there is no database file when we are processing
the device, we are in this state. Correct?=20

If udev has, in the past, successfully processed an event for a device,
but fails while processing a later uevent, it doesn't keep th data from
the previous event. So it could lose the uid_attribute. But the
database file should still exist. Correct?
