Agreed. Then MD will need some refactor to support IO polling, if
possible, since just like I mentioned in patch 0 before, MD doesn't
allocate extra clone bio, and just re-uses the original bio structure.

The 'array' here is not an array of 'struct blk_mq_hw_ctx *' maintained
in struct dm_table as you mentioned. Actually what I mean is to maintain
an array of struct dm_poll_data (or something like that, e.g. just
struct blk_mq_hw_ctx *) in per-bio private data. The size of the array
just equals the number of the target devices.

For example, for the following device stack,

An array of struct blk_mq_hw_ctx * is maintained in struct dm_io B.


struct blk_mq_hw_ctx * hctxs[2];

The array size is two since dm1 maps to two target devices (i.e. nvme0
and nvme1). Then hctxs[0] points to the hw queue of nvme0, while
hctxs[1] points to the hw queue of nvme1.


This mechanism supports arbitrary device stacking. Similarly, an array
of struct blk_mq_hw_ctx * is maintained in struct dm_io A. The array
size is one since dm0 only maps to one target device (i.e. dm1). In this
case, hctx[0] points to the struct dm_io of the next level, i.e. struct
dm_io B.


But I'm afraid the implementation of this style may be more complex.

Sure, the name here is just for example.

It seems that you are referring 'array' here as an array of 'struct
blk_mq_hw_ctx *'? Such as

struct dm_table {
    ...
    struct blk_mq_hw_ctx *hctxs[];
};

Certainly with this we can replace the original 'struct blk_mq_hw_ctx *'
pointer in 'struct dm_poll_data' with the index into this array, such as

struct dm_poll_data {
     int hctx_index; /* index into dm_table->hctxs[] */
     blk_qc_t cookie;
};


But I'm doubted if this makes much sense. The core difficulty here is
maintaining a list (or dynamic sized array) to track all split bios.
With the array of 'struct blk_mq_hw_ctx *' maintained in struct
dm_table, we still need some **per-bio** structure (e.g., &bio->bi_plist
in current patch set) to track these split bios.
