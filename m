I now clearly understand that the 5.8 block changes to do away with
->make_request_fn in favor of a more optimized ->submit_bio (that isn't
applicable for all devices) is why you're pursuing a "fix" so urgently.

As I shared in private: I have some urgent Red Hat business critical
work I need to do and unfortunately cannot put my near-term focus to
implementing a fully baked blk_interposer for DM.  But I can come back
to it (sadly unlikely to do so until the new year though).

While I still think there needs to be a proper _upstream_ consumer of
blk_interposer as a condition of it going in.. I'll let others make the
call.

As such, I'll defer to Jens, Christoph and others on whether your
minimalist blk_interposer hook is acceptable in the near-term.
