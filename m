Hello Martin,

That is exactly the reason why we would need to modularise this. Access
characteristics between different transport protocols can differ
significantly and thus are susceptible to different indicators,
tolerances and other variations that would need a different config
setup. You don't really want to mix and match config options between
the various options as that would significantly increase complexity and
thus make the setup more errorprone. Things may often seem very clear
cut from a develop(ers/ment) perspective however from a system
administration side it gets often very confusing when even the smallest
things start to contradict each other.

When tcp packets timeout from a iscsi based device we're 100% relying
on tcp to sort itself out based on RTT values and slow start behaviour
whereas FC is far more reliant on all upper levels from scsi/nvme-o-f
side. These tolerances should be configurable independantly.

Regards
Erwin
