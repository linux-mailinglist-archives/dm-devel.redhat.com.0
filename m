The confidence is about how it is used.  And that's up to the driver
authors, not helped by them not having any guidelines.  And while
I've touched this code a lot, the split between the two levels of API
long predates me.

The explanation was supposed to be in the Lines above.  Now accounting
is skipped if in a ->submit_bio recursion.  Before that it dependent
on drivers calling either submit_bio or submit_bio_noacct, for which
there was no clear guideline and drivers have been a bit sloppy about.

blktests and the mdadm tests (at least as far as they got upstream, md
or it's tests always seem somewhat broken).  dmtests is something
I've never managed to get to actually run due it's insistence on
using not packaged ruby stuff.

Yes, the branch needs to be later as in this version below.

Because I once again got a question from an auther of a driver that
is planned to be upstreamed on which one to use.  And the answer
was it's complicated, and you really should not have to think about
it, let me dig out my old patch so that driver authors don't have
to care.

Subject: block: remove submit_bio_noacct

The current usage of submit_bio vs submit_bio_noacct which skips the
VM events and task account is a bit unclear.  It seems to be mostly
intended for sending on bios received by stacking drivers, but also
seems to be used for stacking drivers newly generated metadata
sometimes.

Remove the separate API and just skip the accounting if submit_bio
is called recursively.  This gets us an accounting behavior that
is very similar (but not quite identical) to the current one, while
simplifying the API and code base.
