Like I said, if we fix this in multipath, then checking for /dev/loopXpY
devnodes, and setting LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN before deleting the loop device
if they are present seems like a better solution.

But again, you can make a pretty good case that when parted creates
those partition devices, it should set LO_FLAGS_PARTSCAN so that their
devnodes will get cleaned up.

But lvm decides what devices are duplicates by reading them, not by
looking at their name.  So, unless both the /dev/loopXpY and the
/dev/mapper/loopXpY actually are devices, lvm won't have an issue.  If
the /dev/loopXpY devnode is still around, but there's no actual device
connected to it, that lvm issue shouldn't happen.

Leaving devnodes around doesn't cause lvm issues. But adding loop
partitions can cause lvm issues.  This is why I don't like the idea of
kpartx creating them.

But again, that pvcreate WARNING happens when both devices exist. Simply
having a devnode present won't cause it. And adding the '-P' option
won't top both devices from existing at the same time. That being said,
I do understand the desire to clean them up.
