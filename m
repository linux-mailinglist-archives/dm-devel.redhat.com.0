Yes, there is the kernel part of the kdump although there is also the
userspace part to make the feature complete:)

Thanks for the explanation! After reflecting on your words for some
time, I realize I had an implicit assumption. I assumed is if I use a
name like dm_crypt_key instead of luks_volume_key, I need to support all
mappings like plain, bitlocker, veracrypt as mentioned by you and this
could mean much more efforts. So I'm not motivated to do that as
currently users only request kdump to work for LUKS.  

But maybe I can divide the efforts into the kernel part and userspace
part. For the kernel part, almost no effort is needed since only
renaming is needed as pointed out by you. For the userpace part, maybe
it's OK to support preserving key only for LUKS2 in cryptsetup as hinted
by your last paragraph? Does it look good to you from the viewpoint of
the maintainer of cryptsetup?
