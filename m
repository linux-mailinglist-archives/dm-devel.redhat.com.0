This issue has been fixed.  I sent a patch to QEMU for it:

 - https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20220511120541.2242797-1-shorne@gmail.com/T/#u

The issue was a bug in the OpenRISC emulation in QEMU which was triggered when
receiving a TICK TIMER interrupt, in a delay slot, on a page boundary.

The fix was simple enough, but investigation took quite some work.

Thanks,

-Stafford
