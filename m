Sorry I can't understand case 3, could you please further explain it? If
'driver marks such bio as REQ_TAG manually', then per-task io poll
context won't be created, and thus REQ_HIPRI will be cleared, in which
case the bio will be completed by IRQ. How could it be completed by
blk_poll()?

If the use cases are mixed, saying one kernel context may submit IO with
and without REQ_TAG at the meantime (though I don't know if this
situation exists), then the above code may not work as we expect.

For example, dm-XXX will return DM_MAPIO_SUBMITTED and actually submits
the cloned bio (with REQ_TAG) with internal kernel threads. Besides,
dm-XXX will also allocate bio (without REQ_TAG) of itself for metadata
logging or something. When submitting bios (without REQ_TAG), per-task
io poll context will be allocated. Later when submitting cloned bios
(with REQ_TAG), the poll context already exists and thus REQ_HIPRI is
kept for these bios and they are submitted to polling hw queues.
