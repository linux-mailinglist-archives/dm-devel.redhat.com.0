This is basically saying the same thing but:

It could be that the LBA space is fragmented and so falling back to
the smallest region size (that matches the thinp block size) would be
the last resort?  Then if/when thinp cannot even service allocating a
new free thin block, dm-thinp will transition to out-of-data-space
mode.

Yes.

This would be the FITRIM with extension you mention below?  Which is a
filesystem interface detail? So dm-thinp would _not_ need to have new
state that tracks "provisioned but unused" block?  Nor would the block
layer need an extra discard flag for a new class of "provisioned"
blocks.

If XFS tracked this "provisioned but unused" state, dm-thinp could
just discard the block like its told.  Would be nice to avoid dm-thinp
needing to track "provisioned but unused".

That said, dm-thinp does still need to know if a block was provisioned
(given our previous designed discussion, to allow proper guarantees
from this interface at snapshot time) so that XFS and other
filesystems don't need to re-provision areas they already
pre-provisioned.

However, it may be that if thinp did track "provisioned but unused"
it'd be useful to allow snapshots to share provisioned blocks that
were never used.  Meaning, we could then avoid "breaking sharing" at
snapshot-time for "provisioned but unused" blocks.  But allowing this
"optimization" undercuts the gaurantee that XFS needs for thinp
storage that allows snapshots... SO, I think I answered my own
question: thinp doesnt need to track "provisioned but unused" blocks
but we must always ensure snapshots inherit provisoned blocks ;)

So by default FITRIM will _not_ discard provisioned blocks.  Only if
a flag is used will it result in discarding provisioned blocks.

Yeap.
