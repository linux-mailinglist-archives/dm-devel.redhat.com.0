There needs to be a comprehensive audit of the locking and the
granularity of work.  The model VDO uses already requires that
anything that needs a continuation is assigned to the same thread
right?  Matt said that there is additional locking in the rare case
that another thread needs read access to an object.

Determining how best to initiate the work VDO requires (and provide
mutual exclusion that still allows concurrency is the goal). Having a
deep look at this is needed.

The implicit locking of the VDO thread assignment model needs to be
factored out.  If 'use_vdo_wq' is true then the locking operations are
a noop. But if Linux workqueues are used then appropriate locking
needed.

FYI, dm-cache-target.c uses a struct continuation to queue a sequence
of work.  Can VDO translate its ~12 stages of work into locking a vio
and using continuations to progress through the stages?  The locking
shouldn't be overbearing since VDO is already taking steps to isolate
the work to particular threads.

Also, just so you're aware DM core now provides helpers to shard a
data structures locking (used by dm-bufio and dm-bio-prison-v1).  See
dm_hash_locks_index() and dm_num_hash_locks().

I'm talking about a comprehensive audit of how work is performed.  And
backfilling proper locking by factoring out adequate protection that
allows conditional use of locking (e.g. IFF using linux workqueues).

In the end, using either VDO workqueue or Linux workqueues must pass
all VDO tests.
