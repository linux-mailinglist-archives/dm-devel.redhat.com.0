Late reply but maybe it is still useful :)

There is one remaining problem though, which might be just a cosmetic one: Although ext4 is shut down to prevent it from writing, I sometimes get the error message from the subject in the logs:

Well, shutdown is not 100% tuned for clean teardown. It is mostly a testing
/ debugging aid.

The error recovery path should be cleaning up everything. If not, that
would be a bug :)

Why not just rm -rf $mountpoint/*? That will remove all dirty data from
memory without writing it back. It will cost you more in terms of disk IOs
than the above dance with shutdown but unless you have many files, it
should be fast... And it is much more standard path than shutdown :).

I think something like this might be useful if the "rm -rf" solution is too
slow. But it is a bit of a niche usecase ;).
