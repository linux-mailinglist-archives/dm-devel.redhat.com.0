Sorry there may be some confusion in my description. Let's discuss in
the following scenario: MD/DM advertise QUEUE_FLAG_POLL, though **all**
underlying devices are without QUEUE_FLAG_POLL. This scenario is
possible, if you want to enable MD/DM's polling without checking the
capability of underlying devices.

In this case, it seems that REQ_HIPRI is kept for both MD/DM and
underlying blk-mq devices. I used to think that REQ_HIPRI will be
cleared for underlying blk-mq deivces, but now it seems that REQ_HIPRI
of bios submitted to underlying blk-mq deivces won't be cleared, since
submit_bio_checks() is only called in the entry of submit_bio(), not in
the while() loop of __submit_bio_noacct_ctx(). Though these underlying
blk-mq devices don't support IO polling at all, or they all have been
disabled for polling, REQ_HIPRI bios are finally submitted down.

Or do I miss something?

Sorry I missed the '(bio->bi_opf & REQ_HIPRI)' condition here. Indeed
bio without REQ_HIPRI won't be enqueued into the poll_context.
