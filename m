TL;DR: I'd like to hear the "voice of the user" at this point. So if
anyone except Ben, Brian, and myself has read this far, please speak up
(and read on if you have the patience)!

IIRC we chose "strict" because the previous upstream default had been
the nonsensical "no", and we wanted to stick with a "conservative"
default. This way, we are cautious: we avoid suddenly grabbing a lot of
devices if someone just compiles and runs multipathd on her system.
OTOH, "strict" makes little sense on systems that actually deploy
multipath devices, as Brian described.

Forget about "no".

SUSE has used "greedy" as default basically forever, and it's working=20
well. The only common case where it's not optimal is systems with
local, non-multipath root device. While there's nothing wrong with
using multipath for such a device, users often don't like it because
they think it's going to impact system performance negatively. It is
possible to avoid using multipath on the root disk by simply not adding
the multipath module to the initramfs. The improvements in device
selection logic that we've made during the last years make this setup
work without additional configuration [1].

This applies only to non-multipath devices. For multipath devices,
"smart" uses the WWIDs file just like "yes". So this is about
situations where you have non-blacklisted, non-multipath devices in
your system. In practice, that's again the "non-multipath root"
scenario discussed above. Like above, you can avoid waiting in that
scenario by not adding multipath to the initramfs; after switching
root, the device will be handled by the "released to systemd" logic.
And if you don't do this: with high likelihood, the
find_multipath_timeout of 1s for "unkown devices" will apply to the
non-multipath devices. udev sets the timer for multiple devices in
parallel, so that the delays don't add up. IMO a 1s delay is hardly
noticeable during a typical server startup.

I agree. The idea behind "smart" was to avoid the necessity of
blacklisting, at the cost of a delay. If users go through the procedure
of creating blacklists, they'll be better off with "greedy" most of the
time.

Most of what you are saying makes sense.=A0Your description of different
scenarios shows that "yes", "greedy", and "smart" all have their pros
and cons. No setting is optimal in every situation. We made this
configurable for a reason.=A0

Now the question is which upstream default suits our users best.
We should ask ourselves: who is using the upstream multipath code?

Multipath is mostly for large data centers; I tend to believe that
enterprise distributions and their clones account for a rather big part
of the installations where multipath is in use. In that case, the
distribution defaults apply, which often differ from the upstream
default. The _very_ big users, who basically create their own distros,
will probably also have their dedicated approach to multipath device
selection; no need for us to bother about them.

Experienced long-term multipath users will have no problem with editing
multipath.conf and applying their own settings, and will most probably
have been doing that for years anyway [2]. Thus the upstream default
mostly matters for people who compile multipath locally [3], and for
(new) users of distributions that don't alter the upstream defaults.=A0

For these scenarios, I think that "smart" is the best choice.=A0"smart"
was meant to "do the right thing" for cases where the user doesn't want
to create configuration files. It's also useful for mass deployments.
IMO the boot delay is a small price to pay for getting the closest
approximation of a "right" setup immediately after activating
multipath. Those users who are annoyed by boot delays, caused by non-
blacklisted non-multipath devices with "smart", will consider their
needs and switch this to "yes" or "greedy". Even in mass deployments,
doing so with a tool like ansible isn't a big issue.

Anyway, Ben, the two of us should take a step back here. We are both
opinionated, based on the defaults our respective distributions have
been using for almost two decades.

This is why I asked for the "opinion of the user". I'd like to hear
which settings the practitioners prefer, why, and whether the
preferences differ between different configuration scenarios. I hope
someone is going to speak up. I suppose we'll choose either "yes" or
"smart", and I'm looking forward to hear what our users prefer. It's
not a religious matter to me.

Regards
Martin

[1] Personally, with "greedy" and a non-multipath root disk, I'd
recommend creating a blacklist entry, but it isn't strictly necessary
any more.
[2] In practice, one of the problems I see are overloaded
multipath.conf files that have grown over time and contain setting that
modern multipath-tools wouldn't need any more. But that's a different
issue.
[3] Does anyone do this these days?
