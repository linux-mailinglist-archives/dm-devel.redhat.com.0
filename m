I agree that currently this design pattern has caused blk-core and dm
being tightly coupled together. Maybe it's the most serous problem of
this patchset, personally.

I can explain it though... Since the nature of the IO path of dm, dm
itself doesn't know if the original bio be split to multiple split bios
and thus submitted to multiple underlying devices or not. Currently I
can only get this information in __submit_bio_noacct(), and that's why
there's so much logic specific to dm is coupled with blk-core here.

Besides, as you just pointed out, it's not compatible once other
bio-based devices start to support polling.

Agreed. More checks shall be needed here.

Blk-mq doesn't have this issue. Io_uring will do fget() for input files
that need do IO. fput() will be deferred until the IO has completed.
Thus the polling routine is guarded by fget() and fput(). fget() will
ensure that the underlying disk (struct block_device, struct disk,
struct request_queue, etc.) is pinned there.

In terms for dm, the above can only guarantee that dm device itself is
pinned, while there's no guarantee for the underlying devices once dm
table reload happens.

The reason why all these are mixed is explained as above.
