SID could very well do that. What not returning "maybe" in this case
really does is make it harder use this code for "multipath -u".
multipath needs to know when it should search for other paths.  It
doesn't want to do so before calling mpath_is_path() (or the cut down
libmultipath part). It wants to know that if other paths with the same
wwid exist, then this path would be valid.

But just looking at the SID case, I don't see the problem.  Say SID
passed down an array of known wwids, and this paths wwid wasn't on the
list.  SID needs to know if it should save this WWID for checking
against future paths, so there should be a special return code for this.
That is exactly what "maybe" means in the SMART case. My v2 code makes
is easy for SID to see what the configured mode is.  In this case, it
could set the delay if multipathd was configured as SMART, and not if it
was configured as FIND.  In reality, SID will probably treat SMART and
FIND the same way.  It will eventually have a persistent database, so it
can remember between boots if it has seen a device before. When that
happens it will probably always treat FIND like SMART. Before that
happens, it will probably treat SMART like FIND. So, I'm not totally
aginst removing the maybe, but it can see how that doing so will make
the code simpler for any user of this library (either SID or multipath
-u)

SID's job is to replace all the udev hacks to get devices to be claimed
and set up, with a stateful daemon that had modules for each device
type, written in C. It's job is specifically to know what is using which
device. So these checks were left out intentionally. See below for more
explanation.

yes. SID will have a multipath module that calls this library. That will
live in the SID project, but they will clearly take patches from
multipath developers.

You have to elaborate on this risk, because I don't see it. In the v2
code there are 3 non-error states that can be returns

MPATH_IS_NOT_VALID
MPATH_IS_VALID
MPATH_IS_MAYBE_VALID

I will likely add a fourth state MPATH_IS_CLAIMED, that will only be
returned when a path currently is multipathed, to differentiate it from
the others, which state multipath's desire.  But all SID needs to know
is that MPATH_IS_NOT_VALID, means that multipath isn't claiming it now.
MPATH_IS_VALID means that multipath wants to claim it now, and
MPATH_IS_MAYBE_VALID means that multipath would want to claim the device
if another path with the same WWID came around.  I admit, SID will
likely deal with SMART differently than multipath + udev currently does,
but that doesn't effect how it interfaces with multipathd.

Perhaps there would be more return states necessary, but aside from
MPATH_IS_CLAIMED, I don't see why another state is needed. Maybe I'm
misunderstanding what you mean by "second path always false".

The same issue exists here, where we want to be able to respond quickly.
that's why I'm trying to strip even more unnecessary code out (creating
a lock file just to read if multipathd failed to create the device).

But that's not necessary to do each time, when we can just return the
data to SID, which can store it for future library calls.


I do think that we can move the meat of this library into libmultipath
Here's the claiming logic for my v2 code:

If the device is currently multipathed: valid
If multipathd is not running: not valid
If the device is blacklisted: not valid
If the device does not have a wwid: not valid
If the device wwid is multipathed: valid
If the device failed to be multipathed: not valid
If the mode is GREEDY: valid
If the device wwid is in the wwids file: valid
If the mode is STRICT: not valid
If another path with the same wwid exists: valid
else: maybe valid

Here's the claiming logic for multipath -u

If multipathd is not running: not valid
If the device is blacklisted: not valid
If the device does not have a wwid: not valid
If the device failed to be multipathed: not valid
If the mode is STRICT or FIND and the device is in the wwids file: valid
If the mode is STRICT or FIND and the device is not in the wwids file:
=09not valid
If the device is currently multipathed: valid
If the device has been released to systemd: not valid
If the mode is GREEDY: valid
If the device wwid is multipathed: valid
If the device is not in use and another path with the same wwid exists:
=09valid
If the device is not in use: maybe valid
else: not valid

Differences:

"If the device is currently multipathed" is now first. I think that this
is correct, but I would be willing to move it down. If you get
multipathd into a state where there is a multipath device with what it
thinks are blacklisted paths. When uevent happen on those paths, it
doesn't remove the from the device. So the claiming logic should mirror
that.

"If the device has been released to systemd" doesn't exist. This is by
design, but it could probably use some work.  The idea is that SID (or
anything calling this library) is smarter than udev. The goal of SID is
to move device activation out of udev, and into a daemon that tracks
what is using what device without needing udev rules.  Since SID keeps
track of who has claimed the device, Multipath doesn't need to try and
track if something else was allowed to use the device. On the flip side,
multipath should communicate its ownship a little better.  So, i think
it could have a new state MPATH_IS_CLAIMED. This would only be returned
if the device is currently multipathed. This will make it easy for SID
to know that this device really is claimed by multipath, instead of
multipath simply wanting to claim it. This change is probably not
necessary, since as soon as the multipath device is created, SID get a
uevent for, and could match the WWID with the paths, and claim them for
multipath. But it doesn't hurt anything.

"If the device wwid is multipathed" has been moved above "If the device
wwid is in the wwids file". This means that STRICT will allow the path
event if its not in the wwids file. I think that this is correct on the
same grounds that I think "If the device is currently multipathed"
should be above "If multipathd is not running". It's simply reporing the
actual truth instead of the configured goal. Also, if you look at
ev_add_path(), should_multpath() is only called if the multipath device
doesn't exist. So this is simply matching the claiming behavior to what
multipathd will actually do in this case.

"If the device wwid is multipathed" is also moved above "If the device
failed to be multipathed". Again. If there is currently a multipath
device with that wwid, the the failed file is simply wrong.

"If the device is not in use" doesn't exist.  Again, it is SID (or the
calling program's) job to know if a device is already in use.

Aside from those issues, the checks should return the same results,
unless I'm overlooking something. To make this work for multipath -u we
would have to accept the changes to where "If the device is currently
multipathed" and "If the device wwid is multipathed" are, or move them
in the library code (but like I said, I think the library placement is
more correct to actual multipathd behavior than the multipath -u code
is).

To deal with "If the device has been released to systemd", multipath
would check this if the library returned MPATH_IS_VALID or
MPATH_IS_MAYBE_VALID (but not MPATH_IS_CLAIMED). This would cause a
difference for find_multipaths =3D on or strict.  In this case, once a path
had been released, it would not be claimed simply because it was in the
wwids file.  The path would have to be multipathed.  This doesn't seem
like to big of an issue, but we could always add another return state to
the library, to make this work like it currently does.

To deal with "If the device is not in use", we would simply check this
for "maybe" paths if find_multipaths is "smart".  Since multipath
wouldn't pass any wwids in, this is the case where it currently does
the open O_EXCL check.
