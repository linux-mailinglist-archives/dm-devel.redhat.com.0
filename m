I don't quite understand yet. Assume we read the bindings file and
encounter an alias "mpathab". Is this alias #28 with prefix "mpath", or
is it #2 with prefix "mpatha", or perhaps alias guess-what  (order
"thab") with prefix "mpa"? How would we know at this point in the code?
Are you suggesting that we create a list of all configured prefixes and
compare the bindings we read with each of them?

Our bindings list is now partially sorted, which is an improvement wrt
the previous situation. "missing the gap" is not really an awful
problem [*]. Perhaps we could postpone this for after this patch set,
and give it some more time to sink in?

Martin

[*] I admit that with my patch, we _know_ now that the bindings list
will be sub-optimally sorted as soon as mpathaa is reached, whereas
before the ordering might be perfect even with a large number of
aliases, depending on the history of the bindings file. That's not a
change for the better; it will cause the gap to be missed in some
situations where we don't miss it now. I am not sure how bad this is.
