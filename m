From a quick looks it seems to be like this should be a block driver
just like the loop driver and not use device mapper.  Why would
you use device mapper to basically reimplement a fancy loop driver
to start with?

And this sounds like a pretty fragile design.  It basically requires
both userspace and the kernel driver to access metadata on disk, which
sounds rather dangerous.

What do you need more than a queue freeze?
