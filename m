Not me, but multiple customers of ours :-/ Most of them where running
PowperPC, for reasons I can only speculate about. The user-visible
phenomenon is that some upper layers on some maps (kpartx-created
partitions, LVM, ...) are not present after boot, and "multipathd
reload" fixes the situation.

I suppose it should be reproducible if one has multiple multipath maps
with partitions, devices are discovered somewhat slowly / with delays
during intird processing, and the root device is discovered early on.
Then systemd has enough time to mount the root FS and stop services
before all maps are completely set up. The exact behavior would still
depend on timing (but in the in the last case I worked on, it was 100%
reproducible by the customer).

No, I didn't think of that. It's an interesting idea, although it might
slow down booting. IMO it's actually a good thing that the services in
the initrd are stopped quickly when the root FS becomes available. It
can just have some side effects our current code doesn't deal well
with.

AFAICS, multipathd is not the problem, udev is. I can see that
multipathd has cleanly set up the maps, but udev has been stopped
before processing the respective events (in particular, the change
events).

If this happens, the udev db for the affected maps looks more or less
like this:

DM_UDEV_DISABLE_SUBSYSTEM_RULES_FLAG="1"
DM_UDEV_DISABLE_DISK_RULES_FLAG="1"
DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG="1"

The device-mapper hotplug mechanism doesn't help here, because it tries
to import properties from the db. Triggering uevents in other ways
helps even less. Only a "genuine" change event without the "reload"
flag (DM_SUBSYSTEM_UDEV_FLAG0) set will do the trick.

When multipathd starts after switching root, it sees the maps in
perfect state as far as multipath properties are concerned, and thus
will not set the force_udev_reload flag. This patch changes that.

(My break-through step when I attempted to understand the issue was to
tell customers to tar up /run/udev/data before starting coldplug. That
way I could see the state in which the udev db was left when initrd
finished, and I saw the half-completed entries like above).

I suppose this works differently on Red Hat where you use mpathconf and
set up only a very limited set of maps during initrd processing.
Therefore my guess was you'd not see this at all. I'm still wondering
why we have been seeing it only very recently. *Perhaps* my recent
changes to make multipathd shutdown more quickly are part of the
equation, I'm unsure about that. I am pretty positive that this patch
is effective, though.

Regards,
Martin
