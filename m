dm-thinp offers its own much more scalable snapshot support (doesn't
use old dm-snapshot N-way copyout target).

dm-snapshot isn't going to be modified to support this level of
hardening (dm-snapshot is basically in "maintenance only" now).

But I understand your meaning: what you said is 100% applicable to
dm-thinp's snapshot implementation and needs to be accounted for in
thinp's metadata (inherent 'provisioned' flag).

Yeah, I was getting tripped up in the weeds a bit.  It's pretty
straight-forward (and like I said at the start of our subthread here:
this follow-on work, to inherit provisioned flag, can build on this
REQ_PROVISION patchset).

All said, I've now gotten this sub-thread on Joe Thornber's radar and
we've started discussing. We'll be discussing with more focus
tomorrow.
