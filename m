I agree that these new defaults are sensible, but this patch will cause
some user's arrays to change configuration when they update.  I'm not
against doing this at all, but this is one of those patches that
distributions need to take some care with, so that they can make this
change at a sensible time.

So, unless there are other objections, I'm O.k. with this patch set, I
just wanted to point this out.
