Hi my name is Akira Hayakawa. I am maintaining an out-of-tree DM target
named dm-writeboost.

Sorry to step in. But this is a very interesting topic at least to me.

I have been looking for something like dm-user because I believe we should
be able to implement virtual block devices in Rust language.

I know proxying IO requests to userland always causes some overhead but for
some type of device that performance doesn't matter or some research
prototyping or pseudo device for testing, this way should be developed. Of
course, implementation in Rust will give us opportunities to develop more
complicated software in high quality.

I noticed this thread few days ago then I started to prototype this library
https://github.com/akiradeveloper/userland-io

It is what I want but the transport is still NBD which I don't like so
much. If dm-user is available, I will implement a transport using dm-user.

- Akira
