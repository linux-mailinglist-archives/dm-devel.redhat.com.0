Yes, this is the primary reason I'm exploring this. I tried to find an
implementation that might be useful in other situations which is why I
landed on this approach.

Thanks for explaining and providing that context.

Absolutely, we could perhaps create a new ioctl which allows the
caller to specify the maximum open count, and when the open count hits
that value it fails any new opens with -EBUSY. Perhaps this would be
enforced in dm_get_device? This type of behavior could theoretically
mimic the patch I mailed when used in conjunction with deferred
removal. Is this an approach you think might make more sense with the
existing design? Are there any implementation points you believe might
make more sense for such a feature?

I cannot immediately think of a situation where you'd do this without
deferred removal.

Yes, absolutely. I'll happily send patches for userspace libraries,
applications, and documentation once we converge on an acceptable
approach.

Thanks again for spending your time discussing this,
Brian
