I don't remember if I mentioned this in the thread, but it was definately in
the Plumbers talk, but I'd had the general idea bouncing around that it would
be possible to write a high-performance version of this using an interface
similar to the one provided here while relying on io_uring for the
high-performance userspace.  That definately won't work with exactly the
current interface, but my hope was to avoid writing my own high-performance
ring buffer.  My worry was that it'll be too tricky to map this all to
zero-copy, and I guess I forgot about it.

Now that you bring it up, it certainly seems worth taking a shot at.  We'd
essentially have the best of both worlds: userspace implementations that want
to be simple could just use read()/write(), while those that want to be higher
performance could have their implicit ring buffer.

I'm currently trying to put together a benchmarking setup that is of sufficient
fidelity that I would believe the numbers, which is really why I don't have any
performance numbers yet (no sense posting numbers I would shoot down :)).  I'll
try to remember to take a shot at an io_uring based userspace (probably with
some dm-user interface modifications) to see how it feels.
