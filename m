I think so as well, but that doesn't appear to be what the proposed
implementation for ext4 does. I'm not intimately familiar with ext4, but
it looks to me like it only provisions on initial allocation..?

That makes sense for a purely thin provisioned device, but runs into
issues with block layer snapshots (re: my comments on the provision
mount option patch). I wonder if it makes more sense to provision at
some point before submitting writes or dirtying pagecache. IIRC we had
prototyped something in XFS a while back that performed an analogous
dm-thin fallocate at the time an extent is mapped for writes. I'm not
sure what the performance impact of that would be or if there's a nice
way to optimize away the obvious side effect of spurious requests.

Yeah, that's a good question. IMO we should be able to use something
like this to improve the failure handling for fs' over thinly
provisioned storage with dangerously low free space. There's not much
point in just submitting writes in response to failed provisions in that
case, but perhaps there is some more incremental use case or benefit I'm
not aware of..?

The flipside of more reliably graceful error handling is there may be
more to the minimal solution than just firing off provisions on initial
allocation, unless you wanted to just rule out snapshots I guess. That
said, I think there's still potential opportunity for improvement. For
example, if a prototype did something like the following:

- Provision the log at opportunistic points (i.e., on mount, first
  transaction to a covered log, etc.) to guarantee log writes won't
  fail.
- Provision extents mapped for data writes before the write is allowed
  to proceed.
- Do something similar for metadata in AIL processing or some such,
  where each item must be provisioned before written back.
- Shutdown the fs in response to any provision failure.

... obviously that comes with caveats, possibly bad performance, etc.,
but it would be interesting to see if that is sufficient to catch most
scenarios where a write would otherwise get to an out of space volume
causing it to become inactive. If that could be made to work well
enough, perhaps the fs shutdown step could be replaced with some kind of
in-core pause/freeze like mode where the admin has the opportunity to
either add more storage and continue or explicitly shutdown to save the
volume.

OTOH if that just doesn't work out, perhaps this can be combined with
other schemes to reliably prevent inactivation, such as the reservation
mechanism the dm guys had prototyped in the past. Of course that
potentially complicates the interface between the fs and dm-layer.

Thanks. That seems reasonable to me, but again isn't what the patches
appear to implement. ;P

I guess from the standpoint of an I/O command, it probably makes more
sense to unshare by default. Why else would one send the command
otherwise? The falloc api is what it is at this point, so the bdev folks
could always decide if/how to implement a non-unsharing variant if there
happens to be some reason to do that.
