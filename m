dm-zoned checks for conventional zones and also that all zones have a zone
capacity that is equal to the zone size. The first point puts ZNS out but
a second regular drive can be used to emulate conventional zones. However,
the second point (zone cap < zone size) is pretty much a given with ZNS
and so rules it out.

If anything, we should also add a check on the max number of active zones,
which is also a limitation that ZNS drives have, unlike SMR drives. Since
dm-zoned does not handle active zones at all, any drive with a limit
should be excluded. I will send patches for that.

It is a possibility. Indeed, if the ZNS drive has:
1) zone capacity equal to zone size
2) a second regular drive is used to emulate conventional zones
3) no limit on the max number of active zones

Then dm-zoned will work just fine. But again, I seriously doubt that point
(3) holds. And we should check that upfront in dm-zoned ctr.

Getting the exact drive characteristics (zone size, capacity and zone
resource limits) will tell you if dm-zoned can work or not.
