Correct.

They're not the same price though. Remember these disks are mixed
sizes and various ages, exposing their entire data value
(4d+8d+12d+12p gives you 24T of usable storage) all protected by the
single parity disk.

Yes, higher levels of RAID will always be better. However, that's not
how these millions of appliances are developed by a number of
manufacturers and sold at your local retailer. The proposal (and ask
for help) that I've raised is to have an open-source solution to these
proprietary MD implementations, as opposed to being trapped with buggy
MD drivers on firmware that's glitchy and breaks other aspects of the
kernel.

This is long solved by a number of FUSE filesystems, as well as
overlayfs (which would be nice if it could gradually spool data down
into layers, but that's another ball of wax).

Hopefully that makes sense. The only thing that's coming closer to
this is bcachefs, but that's still looking like a multi-year long road
(with the above being deployed in homes since the early 2000s).
