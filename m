Our ideas are not so far apart, but this is the wrong thread on the
wrong mailing list :-) Adding dm-devel.

My thinking is: if during startup multipathd encounters existing maps
with member devices missing in udev, it can test the existence of the
devices in sysfs, and if the devices are present there, it shouldn't
flush the maps. This should probably be a general principle, not only
during startup or "boot" (wondering if it makes sense to try and add a
concept like "started during boot" to multipathd - I'd rather try to
keep it generic). Anyway, however you put it, that means that we'd
deviate at least to some extent from the current "always rely on udev"
principle. That's what I meant. Perhaps I exaggerated the difficulties.
Anyway, details need to be worked out, and I expect some rough edges.

If multipathd had started during initrd processing, it would have seen
the uevents for the member devices. There are no "remove" events, so
multipathd might not even notice that the devices are gone. But libudev
queries on the devices could fail between pivot and coldplug, which is
perhaps even nastier... Also, a daemon running like this would live in
a separate, detached mount namespace. It couldn't just reread its
configuration file or the wwids file; it would have no access to the
ordinary root FS.=20

Hm. I hear you, but I am able to run "multipath -a" and add a wwid to
the file without it being created. Actually I'm able to add bogus wwids
to the file in this way.
